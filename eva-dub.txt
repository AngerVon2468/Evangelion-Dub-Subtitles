===================

Like a cruel angel
Young boy, become legend.
When a blue wind
Knocks on the door to your heart
You just gaze back at me
And smile oh so gently
So eager for something
You touch so softly
Those innocent eyes
Know nothing of the fate that awaits
But one day, you will realize
That upon your back
You have wings
You can fly to the faraway future
The cruel angel's thesis
One day, you'll take off through a window
If your overflowing pathos
Leads you to betray your memories
Then embrace the heavens and shine bright
Young boy, become legend.
2015 A.D.
(helicopter blades thrumming)
(insects buzzing)
(squawks)
MAN (over P.A.): Today at 12:30 p.m.,
a state of special emergency
has been declared in the Tokai region
and the surrounding regions of mid-Kanto.
All residents must vacate to the designated
evacuation shelter immediately.
I repeat, today at 12:30 p.m.,
I repeat, today at 12:30 p.m.,
a state of special emergency
has been declared in the Tokai region
has been declared in the Tokai region
and the surrounding regions of mid-Kanto.
All residents must promptly vacate...
MISATO: How could I lose him at a time like this?
(sighs) Just my luck.
OPERATOR: Due to a state of special emergency,
all phone lines are currently disabled.
Please try again later.
(sighs) Seriously?
(telephone beeps)
I shouldn't have come.
(sighs)
There's no way I'll make it on time.
It's not possible.
Might as well head to a shelter. Hmm?
(chirping fades)
-(rumbling)-
(gasps)
(wires whipping)
(gasping)
(heavy footsteps echoing)
(shudders)
WOMAN: TARGET ADVANGE ESTIMATION Unidentified object
maintaining advance TARGET ADVANCE ESTIMATION to headquarters.
MAN: We now have visual.
Routing image to main monitors.
(announcements continue indistinctly)
After 15 years...
GENDOH: Yes, there's no doubt.
It's an Angel.
EPISODE 1: ANGEL ATTACK
(missiles whooshing)
(gasps)
PILOT: Direct hit on the target.
(screams)
(yelps)
(gasps)
(tires squeal)
-(car door opens)-
Huh?
Hey there.
Sorry I'm late.
(both gasp)
-(alarm blaring)-
MAN: Target unaffected.
Maintaining advance toward Tokyo-3.
WOMAN: The air units are unable to stop its advance.
-(announcements continue)-
This is an act of war.
Deploy all units from Atsugi and Iruma.
Throw everything at it.
Destroy the target at all costs!
What's going on?!
That was a direct hit!
It wiped out our tank battalion.
Guided munitions, bombs, and artillery
are having no effect.
Damn it!
We need more firepower!
Is that the work of the AT Field?
Yes. Standard weaponry is useless against the Angels.
(telephone rings)
Copy that, sir.
We'll deploy the ordnance according to plan.
(beeping)
I can't believe it.
They're arming an N2 mine! Are they nuts?!
Get down!
(rumbling)
(both yell)
(debris falling)
Got him!
You have my sympathies.
Seems your services weren't warranted.
WOMAN: Shock wave incoming.
(static crackles)
MISATO: Are you all right?
SHINJI: Yeah.
My mouth tastes like dirt, though.
MISATO: You'll be fine. Well...
okay, ready?
(both grunting)
(sighs) Couldn't have done it without you.
Thanks for all the help.
Sure. I should thank you as well, Ms. Katsuragi.
Call me Misato, all right?
It's nice to finally meet you...
-Shinji Ikari.- You, too.
OFFICER: What's the status of the target?
WOMAN: Due to EMI, cannot ascertain target.
The blast was massive.
It couldn't survive that.
MAN: Sensors back online.
(beeps)
WOMAN: Energy readings at ground zero!
-What the hell?!-
MAN: Visual feed back online.
(officers gasp)
That was our ace in the hole.
-(sighs)-
Unbelievable.
Goddamn monster!
(squelching)
(warbling)
(rattling)
MISATO: Yes. Quit worrying.
His safety is my top priority.
Just get the car train ready for us,
and make it a direct line.
That's fine.
Look, I said I'd pick him up,
so it's my responsibility to get him there, okay?
-Bye.-
(car phone beeps)
(moans)
This is the worst.
I just finished getting this car restored,
and it's banged up already.
It's gonna cost me a fortune to fix it,
and I still have 33 more months before it's paid off.
And my only decent outfit is ruined.
Um, Miss Misato...
I got all decked out today, too. (moans)
Um, Miss Misato...
Hmm? What is it?
Is this okay?
With, you know, those?
Oh, that. (laughs)
Don't worry about it.
I had to get the car moving,
and this is an emergency situation.
I may not look like it,
but I'm an international civil servant,
so this is perfectly A-OK.
Well, that doesn't sound very convincing.
Lighten up, will you?
For someone with such a cute face,
-you sure are uptight.-
(gasps)
Maybe I am.
Huh? What's wrong?
Wait. Are you hurt? (laughs)
Don't want to hurt a young boy's feelings.
Well, Miss Misato, you don't seem to act your age, either.
-(sputters)- (screaming)
FUYUTSUKI: As predicted, its body is regenerating.
Of course. Otherwise,
it'd be worthless as a stand-alone weapon.
(radio chatter)
(all gasp)
Wow. Quite exceptional.
It seems to have enhanced its abilities.
GENDOH: And it's become smarter.
FUYUTSUKI: It's only a matter of time before it resumes its advance.
-(alarm blares)-
ANNOUNCER: Gate closing.
Please stay clear. The train will...
SHINJI: Special agency NERV?
MISATO: Yeah. It's a secret organization
operating under the U.N.
My father works there, doesn't he?
That's right. And do you know what it is your father does?
ANNOUNCER: This shuttle will pass all stations on the way.
A teacher once told me that he has
the admirable job of defending humanity.
(telephone hangs up)
As of this moment, you have command over this operation.
Let's see what you can do.
Understood, sir.
Ikari, it's evident that none of the ordnance
at our disposal has any effect against the target.
But you still believe you can defeat it.
NERV exists for that very reason.
Then don't let us down.
WOMAN: Target status remains unchanged.
Our current intercept capacity is at 7.5%.
It seems the U.N. forces have given up.
What are your intentions?
We'll activate Unit 01.
Use Unit 01?
But there's no pilot for it.
No matter.
Another spare will arrive shortly.
-(train rumbling)-
Are we on the way to go see my father right now?
Uh-huh.
At least, I think so.
(shudders)
SHINJI: Father.
Oh, I almost forgot.
-Did your father send you any 1.D. forms?-(gasps)
-Yeah.-
(zipper unzips)
-Here.-
Thanks so much.
Come here!-Gendoh Ikari
Oh, right. Give this a read-through, okay?
"NERV"?
My father's work.
Is there something I'm supposed to do at NERV?
I mean, there has to be, right?
Father wouldn't have sent me this letter if there wasn't.
I get it. You're not comfortable around your father, are you?
That makes you just like me.
Huh?
Oh, wow.
An actual Geo-Front!
That's right. And directly below us
is our secret base, NERV Headquarters,
a bastion integral to the restoration of the world
and protector of humanity.
MISATO: Oh, I don't understand.
I'm positive this is the way.
This is no place for a lady wearing a skirt. (sighs)
But whatever. I wonder where Ritsuko would go right now.
I'm so sorry. Still not used to this place.
We already passed through here.
(sighs) Don't worry about a thing.
NERV has systems in place exactly for this.
WOMAN (over P.A.): Dr. Ritsuko Akagi.
Dr. Ritsuko Akagi of Technology Division Section 1
and Project E Director,
please contact Captain Misato Katsuragi
of Operations Division Section 1.
Unbelievable.
She's lost, isn't she?
-(motor whirring)-(dial clicking)
(bell dings)
(gasps) Uh, hello, Ritsuko.
-(grunts)-(nervous chuckle)
Stop messing around, Captain Katsuragi.
We're too short on both time and people.
(chuckles) Sorry.
(sighs)
So, is this the boy?
Yep. He's the Third Children,
as reported by the Marduk Institute.
It's a pleasure.
Huh? Oh, hi.
He resembles his father quite a lot,
like not being able to make himself endearing.
I'll leave you in charge.
(lift motor whirs)
Three whole years since they've seen each other.
-(telephone ringing)-
MAN: Deputy Commander.
The target has begun moving again.
All right. All personnel to battle stations, condition one.
WOMAN: I repeat,
battle stations, condition one.
Ready ordnance for ground intercept.
MISATO: So they say.
RITSUKO: Seems like a big deal.
MISATO: What's the state of Unit 01?
RITSUKO: It's in type-B configuration while being cooled down.
MISATO: Is that thing even operational? It hasn't worked once, right?
RITSUKO: Success rate is 0.000000001%.
Somebody already nicknamed it the 0-9 System.
MISATO (chuckles): Cute. So it doesn't work.
RITSUKO: Oh, come now. It's not exactly zero.
MISATO: Sure, numerically, I guess.
(sighs) Well, unfortunately,
we don't have the luxury of accepting failure anymore.
(door whirs)
(Shinji whimpers)
-I-It's so dark.-(light clicks)
(gasps)
A face? Is that a robot?
(grunts)
You won't find any record of it.
-Huh?-
The ultimate man-made,
multipurpose, decisive combat weapon,
the artificial human,Evangelion.
This is Unit 01.
Constructed in secrecy,
it's the very last trump card humanity has in the deck.
This is my father's work, isn't it?
-GENDOH: That's correct.-(gasps)
It's been quite a while.
(gasps) Father.
(chuckles)
Launch the Eva.
Launch the Eva? We can't!
Unit 00 is still grounded.
(gasps) Wait.
You aren't talking about Unit 01, are you?
We have no other choice.
And, Rei, she's in no shape to pilot anything.
We don't have any pilots.
One has just arrived.
(gasps) You're crazy.
Shinji Ikari...
-Yes?-
You will be its pilot.
Huh?
MISATO: What are you saying?
It took Rei Ayanami seven months
before she would synchronize with an Eva.
He just got here. How could he do it?
All I'm asking is that he simply sit in the cockpit.
-You can't.-
Our number one priority is defeating the Angels.
For that reason, any pilot even remotely capable
must try,
no matter their experience.
You should understand that, Captain Katsuragi.
(sighs)
MISATO:Yes.
Father, why did you send for me?
We just told you why.
So then I'm supposed to jump inside
and fight whatever I saw out there?!
Correct.
No! I don't want to!
After all this time, why now?!
You left me becauseI was no use to you, right?
A need a rose, so I sent for you.
But why? Why me?
Because this task would be impossible for others.
It's impossible for me, too.
I've never even heard of this thing until now,
and you want me to fight in it?!
They will explain how.
Explain?
It's all too much.
I cannot pilot this thing!
Stop wasting time.
Either get in the Eva, or get out.
(rumbling)
The bastard. It knows where we are.
(energy surges)
WOMAN: Layer one's armor plating 08
has been destroyed.
Shinji, we are out of time.
MAN: Layers have broken down
in numerous locationsin Block T.
-Emergency lockdown...-(gasps)
Get in the Eva.
No, I can't.
Besides, I just got here.
Why do I have to do this?
Shinji, tell me...
why did you come all the way here?
Don't run away now,
not from your father and especially not from yourself.
I know, but...
I can't! I can't do this!
(machinery beeping)
Fuyutsuki.
Wake up Rei.
In her condition?
She's not dead.
Very well, then.
-Rei.-
REI: Yes?
The backup isn't working out.
-I need you again.-
Yes.
Recalibrate Unit 01's system to Rei's configuration.
-Reactivate.-
WOMAN: Roger.
Suspending all current tasks and reinitializing.
SHINJI: I knew it.
No one wants me.
(wheels rattling)
(gasps)
(groans)
(panting)
(all gasping)
Ikari!
(Ikari yelps)
(debris splashing)
MAN: Eva! It moved!
MAN 2 (gasps): But how?
MAN 3: Its right armbroke the restraints.
What? That's impossible.
The Eva's entry plug isn't even inserted right now.
It can't move without it.
It just reacted without an interface connection.
Wait. Could it be trying to...
protect him?
Okay.
(Shinji gasps)
(groans)
(shuddering)
SHINJI: Don't run away now.
Don't run away.
Don't run away. Don't run away.
Don't run away.
I'll do it.
I'll be its pilot.

MAYA: Entry plug flooding.
(gasps) Wait. What is this?
(gasps)
Relax, Shinji. Allow the liquid to completely fill your lungs.
Oxygen will transfer directly into your blood stream.
-You'll get used to it.-
(grunting)
(gags)
Eh, this is so gross.
Just deal with it!
-Come on! Be a big boy!-
(groans)

Transport Eva Unit 01 to launch bay.
Launch tube clear. All green.
WOMAN: Preparations complete.
Roger that.
Do I have your consent?
GENDOH: Absolutely.
Our future depends on defeating the Angels.
Ikari, are you really sureabout all of this?
Launch Eva!
-(groans)-
(beeping)
(heavy footsteps echoing)
(alarm blaring)
MISATO: Shinji, please don't die.
TO BE CONTINUED

RITSUKO:Are you ready, Shinji?
(grunts)Yes.
This is it.Release the final safety locks!
Evangelion Unit 01, lift off!
Shinji, try walking.
Just concentrateyour thoughts on it.
SHINJI:Walk.
(gasping)
It's walking!
Walk.
(gasping)
-MISATO: Shinji!-(gasps)
Can you hear me?
Get up!You need to get up now!
(panicked breathing)
-(grunting)-MISATO: Stay calm.
Your arm only feelslike it's being hurt.
What aboutthe defense systems?
MAYA:The signal isn't active!
MAKOTO:It's not generating a field.
There's nothing.
(snapping)
-MAYA: Forearm critical!-MAKOTO: Circuits ruptured.
Break loose, Shinji!
(crashing)
Aah!
There's a fracturein the frontal cranium.
The armor can't take much more.
(crashing continues)
SHIGERU:Major cranial damage.Extent unknown.
MAYA:Nervous systemcontrol circuits are failing.
MAKOTO:Pilot not responsive.
Shinji, respond!
(cicadas buzzing)
I don't know this ceiling.
EPISODE 2: UNFAMILIAR CEILINGS
(helicopter blades whirring)
(whistle blowing)
MAN:Ready. Keep it coming!
MR. GREEN:So, the Angels have returned.
A bit sudden, don't you think?
MR. YELLOW:It's exactly like 15 years ago.
A calamity never giveswarning before it strikes.
In a way, it's a blessing.The appearance of an Angel
makes all of ourpast investments worthwhile.
Don't be so certain of that.
If the investment is not useful,it's still a waste.
Indeed.
Informationregarding the Angels
is spreading among the public.
Something must be done.
NERV will have to workvery quickly and comprehensively
to conduct disinformation.Nothing less will suffice.
Arrangements have alreadybeen carried out
regarding that matter.No need for concern.
REPORTER: This morning,the prime minister's office
in Tokyo-2released a statement
URGENT GOVERNMENT PRESS CONFERENCE(LIVE)
URGENT GOVERNMENT PRESS CONFERENCE(LIVE)
CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY MAYUMI
WOMAN:United Nations forces...
GOVERNMENT'S EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE (Live)
MISATO:I see the B-22 scenariois in full effect.
MISATO:I see the B-22 scenariois in full effect.
Once again,the truth is swept under.
RITSUKO:At least the public affairsoffice is happy.
They feel useful for once.
I appreciate their senseof optimism.
RITSUKO:To be honest, I think they'remore scared than anything.
Yeah, and they should be.
MR. BLUE:Yes, that is all too true.
Ikari, don't you agreethat NERV and the Evas
could be managedmore judiciously?
To start, there's Unit 00,and now Unit 01
needs massive repairsafter its debut.
Lesser nationswould go bankrupt.
Yes, and on top of that,
I heard you gave that toyto your very own son.
Time, money, personnel--you and your son
have an insatiable appetitefor resources.
And do not forgetyou have other duties
that require attention.
The HumanInstrumentality Project,
that mission should beyour top priority.
Indeed.
That projectis the sole source of hope
under the current desperateand destitute circumstances.
For us, of course.
In either case, reschedulingthe project's progression
will not be tolerated bythe members of this council.
Your budget request, on theother hand, we will consider.
MR. GREEN:The council will continuethis meeting without you.
MR. YELLOW:Good work, Commander Ikari.
KEEL:Ikari, there's no turning back.
GENDOH:Yes, I'm well aware of that.
Humanity has little timeto spare.
(high-pitched pulsing)
(door opens)
(wheels rattling)
Air conditioning is humanity'sgreatest invention.
It's the peakof scientific endeavor.
Well, Shinji is finally awake.
MISATO:And? How is he?
RITSUKO:No injuries.
But he doesn't exactlyremember what happened.
What if it's psychologicalcontamination?
That doesn't seemto be a concern.
Really?
(sighs)Eh, makes sense.
He was thrown in the deep endwithout warning.
Not surprising.
His cranial nerves took ona lot of stress during battle.
That's one thing,but then what about his heart?
(whistle blowing)
GUIDED MUNITIONS SYS. BUILDING NO. 25
(workers chattering)
Once the Evas and this cityare fully operational,
things might work out.
Oh, you think we have a chance?
Optimistic as ever, I see.
MISATO:I'll have you know that optimism
is an essential ingredientfor living a full life.
RITSUKO:Really?I do appreciate your outlook.
MISATO:Well...
WOMAN: Dr. Ugai, InternalMedicine, Department One,
please contact Dr. Azuma,Surgical Department...
WOMAN 2:The medical conferenceregarding Exhibit B
will begin shortly.
All attendees, please gatherin Conference Room Two.
Thank you.
(elevator bell dings)
(elevator whirring)
RITSUKO:Are you sure they shouldbe living separately?
FUYUTSUKI:In the Ikari family,living separately
from one another is the norm.
RITSUKO:Living together is difficultfor them, you mean?
MISATO: By himself?
MAN:Correct, a roomin Block 6 nearby
will be his living quarters.
It shouldn't be a problem.
MISATO:Sir.
Are you okay being alone?
Shinji?
Well, actually,I prefer it that way.
It's all the same to me.
-What did you say?!-Like I said,
instead of livingall alone by himself,
Shinji will live with me.
I already got permission.
And don't worry,it's not like I'm gonna try
any funny businesswith some kid.
Of course you're not!
Why would you evensay something like that?
-I can't believe you!-Geez, you really need
to learn to take a joke,Ritsuko.
MISATO:All right!
Tonight we are gonna par-tay!
Party for what?
A welcome party for the arrivalof my new roomie, of course.
(scanner beeping)
WOMAN 1:Oh, you're really moving?
WOMAN 2:Yeah, we are.
It's just not safe anymore.
We never thought this citywould turn into a battlefield.
WOMAN 1:Who would?This whole thing is crazy.
My husband wants me to takethe children and evacuate, too.
WOMAN 2:Evacuate?
You know, they say this cityis supposed to be a fortress,
but I guessyou can't count on that.
WOMAN 1:Right? I get chills
just thinking aboutwhat happened yesterday.
WOMAN 2:Yeah, me, too.
MISATO: Before we go home,I want to take a little detour.
Detour to where?
(chuckles)Someplace very special.
It's kind of...empty and sad, isn't it?
Look, it's time.
(siren wailing)
Oh, wow!The buildings!
This city is a fortressbuilt to counter the Angels.
This is Tokyo-3,and this is our city.
What's more...it's the city you defended.
Looks like they movedyour stuff already, Shinji.
Also, to be honest,I recently moved here myself,
so I'm kind of new, too.
Well, come on in.
Uh, I, uh...
Thanks for having me.
Shinji, this is your home, too.
Then... guess I'm home.
Welcome home.
So, it's a little messyright now,
but don't worryabout it, okay?
SHINJI:This is... a little?
Hey, Shinji?
Can you put the food we boughtin the fridge, please?
Uh... sure thing.
Ice.
Snacks.
And beer.
Is that all she has?
(fridge whirring)
SHINJI:Hey, what about the otherrefrigerator?
Oh, don't open that one. Don'twant to disrupt the sleeper.
Sleeper?
(ding)
MISATO:Okay, let's eat!
SHINJI:Yeah, let's.
(gulping)
(gasps, shouts)
After a long day at work,
this is what makes itall worthwhile!
Aah! Hmm?
Aren't you hungry?
I know it's all microwaved,but it's still pretty good.
I am, it's just...
I'm not really that usedto eating food like this.
What?!Not good enough for you?!
Uh, that's not what I meant.
It's fine.
-Isn't this so fun?-Uh...
Getting to share mealswith others like this.
Sure.
MISATO:Okay, here we go.
Rock, paper, scissors.
One, two, three,
shoot!
Aw, too bad, Shinji.Sorry.
All right, looks likewe're all done.
The daily choresare divided up fair and square.
-Yeah.-And don't forget,
this place is gonna beyour home from now on.
So make yourselffeel at home, okay?
Uh, yes, ma'am.
(groans)"Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am."
It's all you ever say.Boring!
Grow a spine, show some grit.
Be a big boy for once, huh?
Yes, ma'am.
You know what?
You should trytaking a hot bath.
(sighs)It'll clean your head right out.
It's the washing machineof life.
(whimpers)
(screaming)
(Shinji screaming)
M-M-Miss-Miss-Miss Misato!
Uh, what?
Uh, there's a... th-there's a...
There's a...
Him?He's a hot spring penguin.
It's a type of bird.
(penguin squawks)
(door closes)
That's a what?
His name is Pen-Pen.He's my other roommate.
So, care to hide it?
Huh...
Ah!
MISATO:I wonder if I'm laying it ona bit too thick.
He might see right through itif I'm not careful.
(water dripping)
SHINJI:Miss Misato Katsuragi.
She seems nice.
It's the washing machineof life.
But when I'm in the bath,
I can only thinkof the bad things.
Like Father and...
Rei Ayanami.
RITSUKO:So, how is Rei doing?
Didn't you visit herthis afternoon in the hospital?
She'll recoverin 20 days or so.
We should haveUnit 00 restored
and ready for reactivationby then.
RITSUKO:It'll be difficulton those children.
GENDOH:No one else can pilot the Evas.
So, as long as they're not dead,they have to.
RITSUKO:And how do they feel about it?
Does it even matter?
Hin, Rag,
(music playingthrough headphones)
School Transfer Form: Shinji Ikari
(music stops, cassette clicks)
(music resumes)
MISATO:True, it was a difficultexperience for him.
I don't know if he'd be willingto do it again.
RITSUKO:Well, making surehe's operational
is part of your job.
I know, but it's weird.
I don't knowhow to approach him.
Is that whining?I thought you were the one
who was all gung-ho about this.
Shut it!
On that day, I saw Shinjias nothing more
than a means to an end.
I'm no differentfrom Ritsuko.
Strange-- we worked so hardtoward defeating the Angels.
I should be happier.
SHINJI:Another ceiling I don't know.
There's no surprise.
There isn't anythingin this city
I'm familiar with.
MISATO:This is your home, too.
Why am I here?
(faint crashing)
(crashing intensifying)
SHIGERU:Major cranial damage!Extent unknown!
RITSUKO:Operational integritycompromised.
Sitrep now!
Synchrograph is inverting!Pulse flow is reversing.
-Shut down the circuits.Block the flow.-MAYA: I can't.
The shutdown signalisn't getting through.
Shinji's status?
MAKOTO:Biometrics down.Condition unknown!
SHIGERU:Unit 01 has completelyshut down.
Misato!
(grunts)That's enough.
Abort the operation!Priority: pilot rescue.
Emergency plug eject now!
I can't! My commandsaren't getting through!
What do you mean?
(high-pitched pulsating)
The Eva has reactivated.
Impossible!It's completely nonoperational.
-It's gone...-Berserk.
(roaring)
We've won.
An A.T. Field!
There's no point, as longas the A.T. Field stands.
You can't do anythingto an Angel.
-SHIGERU: Left arm restored.-Amazing.
Unit 01 has alsoraised an A.T. Field.
It's neutralizingthe Angel's phase space.
No, it's not.It's corroding it.
It breached the A.T. Fieldlike it was nothing.
(roaring)
>?
(roaring)
Self-destruct?!
-Whoa...-The Eva...
(heavy footsteps)
(all gasp)
That's the Eva's...
True nature.
(static)
SHIGERU:Circuits are connected.
MAYA:System online.Readings nominal.
MAKOTO:Pilot life signs confirmed.
RITSUKO:Expedite unit recovery.
MISATO:Prioritize pilot rescue.
(gasps lightly)
(gasps)
(Shinji gasping, screaming)
MISATO:Shinji? Can I open the door?
(door opens)
I forgot to tell you something.
People will be gratefuland commend you
for what you did here today.
You should be proud.
So, good night, Shinji.
Keep it up.

With Shinji drifting aboutin his new life,
there was no chancefor him to make new friends.
But the factthat he's the Eva's pilot
makes him a celebrity.

RITSUKO:Good morning,Shinji, how are you?
I'm okay. I thinkI'm getting used to this.
That's good to hear.
Eva dispatch points.Emergency power outlets.
Ordinance housing structures.Recovery points.
Have you memorizedthese locations?
-I think so.-Then let's runthrough it once more.
Normally, an Eva relieson external power
through a connected cable.
In emergencies, it can switchto an internal battery,
but its capacityonly allows the Eva
to be fully activefor one minute.
It can be extendedto five minutes at best
by employing low-gain mode.
And that's the limitto our scientific achievements.
-Understood?-Yes.
We'll continuewhere we left off yesterday.
Starting induction mode.
(beeping, whirring, ticking)
Center on target, and...
pull trigger.
Keep calm, center on target,and...
SHINJI:Pull trigger.
RITSUKO:Next.
Honestly, I'm amazedthat Shinji's willing
to go through with this again.
He's the kind of personwho does whatever he's told.
That's how he makeshis life easier.

EPISODE 3: THE SILENT PHONE
(car horn honking)
(woman speaking indistinctlyon TV)
SHINOHARA (on TV):Hello, and good morning!
Shinohara here,and this morning...
(soft thudding)
Ms. Misato?It's morning already.
(sighing)
MISATO:I just finished my shift.
But as long as I'm back by dusk,it'll be fine.
So, please, I just need sleep.
Okay, I'll go now.
Is today Thursday?
Can you take outthe burnable garage?
Yes, ma'am.
MISATO:Are you settlinginto your school?
-Yeah.-Good.
Have a nice day.
Well, I'm heading out.
(birds chirping)
(phone ringing)
(ringing)
(sighing)
(ringing continues)
Hello?Who is it?
It's you, isn't it, Ritsuko?
So, how's it goingwith your new boyfriend?
Boyfriend?Oh, you mean Shinji, right?
It's been two weekssince he transferred in,
and it seemslike nothing's changed.
No one calls his phone.
He has a phone?
Yeah, everyone needs a phone,
so I gave him one a while ago.
But there's no sign of himusing it at all,
or of anyone calling him.
I'm afraid thathe doesn't have any friends.
Well, it's possible thatShinji is the kind of person
who doesn't really makefriends very easily.
Have you ever heardof the Hedgehog's Dilemma?
Hedgehogs?Those spiky critters?
Hedgehogs have a hard time
sharing their warmthwith other hedgehogs.
Because the closer they get,
the more they just end uphurting each other.
It can be the same with people.
Right now, I thinksome part of Shinji is
afraid of that pain,and it makes him timid.
Well, I'm surehe'll figure it out in time.
As you get older,you try again and again,
and eventually you figure out
the right amountof distance to keep
to avoid hurting each other.
(Kensuke imitating engine roar)
(imitating whooshing, gunfire)
What's going on, class rep?
Did you give him the printoutsI gave you yesterday?
Oh, uh... um...
yeah, about that,
it seemsTohji hasn't been at home.
Aida, Suzuhara's a good friendof yours, isn't he?
So, aren't you worried about himmissing school for two weeks?
KENSUKE:Maybe he's seriously injured.
HIKARI:What? In the incidentwith the giant robot?
But the TV said no one got hurt.
KENSUKE:Come on, you sawthe crater at Mount Takanosu.
And Iruma and Komatsuunits responded.
But they also called in support
from Misawa and Kyushu.
Must've been morethan two dozen casualties.
Some had to have died.
-Tohiji...-Suzuhara...
Well, look at that.
Seems likethere are fewer of us.
Lots of people transferred out.
Their families evacuated.
'Cause there was that big battle
right in the middleof the city recently.
I bet you're the only guywho loves this.
Really eating upall the raw action, huh?
Suppose so.What's up with you, Tohji?
You've been out of schoolfor quite a while.
Did you get caught upin that thing
with the giant robot?
No, but my kid sister did.
My little sister got buriedunder the rubble.
She's alive,but she's in the hospital.
My old man and my uncle areat their labs all the time.
They-- They can'ttear themselves away
from their work.
So, I gotta be there.
Or else my sisterwould be all alone.
I tell you,that damn robot pilot
is completely worthless.
Rampaging all over the place?!
Ugh, you just waituntil I get my hands on him!
Yeah, about that, did you hearwe got a new transfer student?
-We got a newbie?-Yeah, that guy.
He transferred in right after
the incident took placewhile you were away.
Timing seems a little strange,don't you think so, Tohji?
(door rolling open)
-WOMAN (on P.A.): All rise.-(rattling)
TEACHER:Uh, so, as you can see,
in that moment, humanity facedits greatest challenge.
In the last yearof the 20th century,
a meteor withan extraordinarily high mass
struck the South Pole.
The icy continent meltedinstantaneously.
Water levels rose, and the axisof the Earth shifted.
Abnormal weather assaultedthe entire globe
and threatenedall life on Earth.
Half of mankind,
along with thousandsof living species,
were lost forever.
This is now referred toas the Second Impact.
- (beeping)-Economies fell apart.
Ethnic conflictsand civil wars erupted.
Those who survivedexperienced hell on earth.
Those who survivedexperienced hell on earth.
-But, in just 15 years...-(gasping)
-But, in just 15 years...-(gasping)
...we have been able to recover
and rebuildso much of what we lost.
While this issurely a testament
to the greatness of mankind,
it is a direct resultmade possible
due to the blood, sweat, tears,and sheer effort
of your mothers and fathers,the fruit...
(all clamoring)
Back then,I was living in Nebukawa.
-Now I...-Okay, everyone, calm down.
Class is still in session.Please return to your seats.
GIRL:Oh, come on!Trying to boss us around again?
-BOY: Give it a rest.-HIKARI: No, I will not.
(clamoring)
-Oh, well, I...-So tell me,
-how were you chosen?-Was there some kind of test?
Hey, so do you ever get scared?
What's it like in the cockpit?
Well, it's just-- I'm notallowed to talk about it.
-(others groaning)-GIRL: Well, can youat least tell us
-the name of your robot?-I'm not sure.
Everyone calls minean Eva, Unit 01.
BOY:Any special attacks?
GIRL:Tell us, tell us, please!
Well, there'sthis what-you-call-it knife
that vibrates, like ultrasound.
-BOY: What?-GIRL: This is amazing.-(others clamoring)
-(bell ringing)-...which brings me to...
Oh... well...
that's it for today.
HIKARI:All rise, bow!
(clamoring continues)
GIRL:Hey, can you at leasttry to be polite
at the end of class?
(grunting, groaning)
Sorry about that, newbie,
but I had to punch youat least once, you know,
just to settlethe score with you.
Sorry about that.He's a little emotional.
His kid sister got hurtin that battle.
That's just how it is with him.
But I don't...
I don't pilot that thingbecause I want to.
(breathing heavily)
(footsteps approaching)
Emergency call-up.
I'm going to go ahead.
(siren blaring)
WOMAN:A state of special emergency
has been declaredfor the Tokai region
and the surrounding regionsof it in Kanto.
All residents mustimmediately make their way
to their designatedevacuation shelter.
I repeat, a state of...
MAN:I have visualsof inbound target.
It has enteredinto our territorial waters.
All personnelto battle stations.
-Condition one.-MAYA: Roger.
Ready ground-to-air intercept.
MAN:Prepare for surface-to-airinterception.
WOMAN:Ready anti-air systems between
Odawaraand the Gora defense line.
(siren blaring)
(horn blares)
(whirring)
WOMAN:Retraction of centralblock structures
as well as Wards Onethrough Seven now complete.
SHIGERU:Government and appropriateagencies have been notified.
MAKOTO:Target continuing to advance.
WOMAN:Current air defense systems
operating at 48% capacity.
Status of civiliansand noncombatants.
We have confirmation that allevacuations have been completed.
(baby fussing)
ANNOUNCER:Students grade one through nineshould remain...
DETAILED INFORMATION TO FOLLOW AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE.
DETAILED INFORMATION TO FOLLOW AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE.
Just scrolling text again, huh?
This is a classic news blackout.
It's their way of keepingall the civilians in the dark.
This is a once-in-a-lifetimeopportunity.
(siren blaring)
MISATO:So, the fourth Angel strikeswhile Commander Ikari is away
but arrives soonerthan we expected.
Last time,the return took 15 years,
but this timethere was only three weeks
between the Angel attacks.
MISATO:Not very considerateof others, is it?
Bastard's not winningany girls' hearts.
(gunfire, explosions)
What a waste of taxpayer money.
The council is requesting
we launch an Evangelionto intercept.
What a bunch of pushy jerks.
We don't need themto tell us to launch our Evas.
-(alarm blaring)-(whirring)
WOMAN:Entry sequence has started.
Ionizing LCL.
Pressure clamps unlocked.
SHINJI:Father's not even watching.
Why am I doing this...
...when I'm getting punchedin the face for it?
(rumbling)
Listen, do you thinkwe can talk in private?
-What is it?-Come on, please?
All right, fine.
-(Hikari giggling)-TOHJI: Hey, class rep!
-What is it?-We gotta go take a leak.Is that cool with you?
You know, you shouldhave done that
before we had to come down here.
TOHJI:So, what's up?
KENSUKE:I wanna see what it's like
at least once before I die.
-TOHJI: Fighting up top?-KENSUKE: It's the real deal.
And there's no way to knowwhen the enemy will strike next.
TOHJI:Kensuke, what is it with you?
TOHJI:Kensuke, what is it with you?
KENSUKE: This might be ourone and only opportunity, sir.
Look, just help meunlock the doors, okay?
TOHJI: You know going out therewill get you killed.
KENSUKE:Being in here's no guarantee.
KENSUKE:Being in here's no guarantee.
I just wanna see it oncebefore I die.
TOHJI:You dork. NERV is thereto stop that from happening.
KENSUKE:Exactly, and how arethey gonna do that
with the newbiepiloting their robot?
He protected usduring the last battle,
and for thanks,you punched him in the face.
Not once but twice.
If he doesn't get inand pilot it again,
we'll all be dead.
Tohji? Don't you thinkit's your responsibility
to check to seeif he does it or not?
TOHJI:Okay, fine.
You're a real slaveto your passions.
-You know that, don't you?-(chuckling)
(beep)
MISATO:Shinji, are you readyfor launch?
-Yes, ma'am.-Remember,
single burst with a pallet rifle
while neutralizingthe enemy's A.T. Field.
Just do this exactlylike you've done
-in your training.-Yes, ma'am.
-Launch Eva!-(booming, whirring)
(low whooshing)
Oh, yeah, this is definitelythe best day of my life.
-Oh, here he comes!- (buzzing)
(boom echoes)
That's him.
(repeating): Center on targetand pull trigger...
MAYA:A.T. Field deployed.
MISATO:Proceed with the operation,okay, Shinji?
Yes, ma'am.
That idiot!He's obscuring the target!
(panting)
(zapping)
What was that?He's losing already.
-Not down yet.-We're sending upa spare rifle.
Now grab it!
- (beeping)-Shinji! Shinji?
Oh, man,that beatdown you gave him
-must've really shook him up.-How is this my fault?!
-(gasping)-(zapping)
(gasping)
(rapid beeping)
MAN:Umbilical cable severed!
MAN 2:Eva has switchedto internal power.
WOMAN:Operational time limit
four minutes, 53 seconds.
(whirring)
(gasping)
KENSUKE:It's headed right for us!
(both screaming)
MISATO:Shinji, are you all right?
Shinji!5 ji!amage report!
MAKOTO:Minimal. He's good to go.
(groaning)
(both whimpering)
Those guys areShinji's classmates.
What are they doing out there?
-(both whimpering)-(whooshing)
(straining)
Well, isn't he gonna fight back?
Maybe he's not fighting backbecause of us.
He can't movebecause we're in the way!
MAYA:Unit 01 operational limit--
three minutes, 28 secondsand counting!
(crackling, rumbling)
MISATO:Shinji, let themin your cockpit!
Then return to base immediately,all three of you.
-We'll start over.-You know letting civilians
board the entry plugwithout permission
cannot be allowed!
Well, then I'm permitting it.
You're oversteppingyour authority, Captain.
MAYA:Three minutes to Unit 01's
operational time limit.
The Eva will holdits current position as ordered,
and you will ejectthe entry plug immediately.
(whooshing)
MISATO:You two, get in! Now!
(crackling)
TOHJI:Wait a second, is this water?
KENSUKE:My camera! My camera!
(coughing)
-MAKOTO: Start entry sequence.-WOMAN: Re-ionizing LCL.
MAYA:There are circuit abnormalities!
RITSUKO:It's due to the additionof two unsuitable objects.
They're causing noise to mixinto the neural pulse.
(crackling, rumbling)
(straining)
Good job!Now disengage!
MISATO:Use recovery route 34.
-Pull back to...-Hey, newbie!
She's telling you to pull back!
-Don't run away, don't run away.-Newbie!
Don't run.Do not run away.
WOMAN:Progressive knife armed!
(metallic shriek)
MISATO:Shinji, I gave you an order!
Pull back!Pull back!

MAN:Target is completely inactive.
(Shinji sobbing)
(sobbing continues)
(rapid beeping)
(soft typing)
(Tohji groans softly)
TOHJI:It's been three days, huh?
KENSUKE:Since they came downon us like a ton of bricks?
TOHJI:It's been three days thathe hasn't shown up at school.
-He who?-Who do you think?
The newbie.
Makes me wonder what he's up to.
Worried about him?
I'm not worried,I was just wondering.
Man, Tohji, you areso stubborn and awkward.
If you'd just said you're sorry
when you last saw him,then you wouldn't
have to agonize over itfor three days.
Here you go.If you're so worried,
why not do something?
This is his number.Give him a call.
(dialing)

Unable to get a handleon his own feelings,
Unable to get a handleon his own feelings,
Shinji runs away,even from Misato.
However, the organizationeffortlessly drags him back.
No one there hasany kind words for him.

You can't stayin there forever.
Eventually,you'll have to go to school.

TOHJI:Um, we...
We're lkari's classmates.
Names are Aida and Suzuhara.
Aida and Suzuhara?
-Yes.-Yeah, ma'am.
Just call me Suzuhara.
Wait, are you the twothat were inside
Unit 01's entry plugthe other day?
-Yep.-Yes.
I am truly sorryfor any trouble we caused you.
-You see...-You see,
we haven't seen Ikarisince then,
and we got really worried,and so we came here
to check on himand see how he is.
MISATO:Of course.
Well, Shinji's ata NERV training facility.
TOHJI:Oh, that's cool.
KENSUKE:Um, uh, these are the printouts
from school for Ikari.
MISATO:Thank you for bringing theseto me.
I appreciate it.
TOHJI:Then, we'll be on our way.
KENSUKE:Could you tell Ikariwe said hi?
Yes, of course.Thanks.
I definitelydid not expect that.
Dude, she was such a hottie.

(wind whistling)
MISATO:He's only 14.
Burdening himwith the fate of humanity
is a bit much, isn't it?
RITSUKO:Yeah, but we must entrust
the piloting of our Evasto 14-year-olds.
We have no other choice.
MISATO:I know.
So, have you heardanything from Shinji?
That's a no.
Nothing. He reallymight not ever come back.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
It might be better for himnot to come back.
Why is that?
It's just,after the last battle...
MISATO:Why did you ignoremy order, Shinji?
-I'm sorry, ma'am.-You understand
that I'm your operationaldirector, don't you?
-Ma'am?-That means you're obligated
to obey my ordersduring operations.
-Do you understand?-Yes, ma'am.
So make sure thisdoesn't ever happen again.
-Ma'am?-Is any of this
actually gettingthrough to you?
-Yes, ma'am.-Listen up!
Acting like you agree witheverything I say isn't enough!
Do you realize that?
Yes, I understand that, ma'am,
but we won, didn't we?
-So why does it matter?-(gasps)
It may feel likeit makes life easier for you
to just play alongwith whatever other people say,
but thoughtlessly pilotingan Eva like that
will get you killed!
So what?Not the point.
Well, you certainlyhave some balls,
but that kind of bluster
won't win any praisefrom us, Shinji Ikari.
You got that?
I'm not lookingfor any praise.
I'm the only one who canpilot it, isn't that right?
So I'll pilot it.
RITSUKO:I see what you mean.
If piloting the Eva
only causes himpain and suffering
and he's doing it out of duty,
then it's best if he left.
Piloting would mean death.
Sure. However,we still need a pilot.
(running footfalls)
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah...
(groans)
Lieutenant, no!
Aida, you must keep going!
But, Lieutenant, sir,
I could never leave you behind!
I'mSsorry!
Snap out of it!
(groans)
(sighs)
Hmm?
Uh... newbie?
Hey, Ikari!
(insects chirring)
KENSUKE:Guess what.
Tohji got it good.
I heard he got scoldedby his little sister.
She laid into him, saying,
"You know that robotsaved all of us."
It's pretty hilariousto think that a grade-schooler
totally schooled himlike that, right?
(fire crackling,insects chirring)
I like the nighttime.
You don't havethose loud cicadas singing.
When I was younger,it was much quieter.
I guess their numbersare growing.
SHINJI:Ms. Misato said the same thing.
A revival of the ecosystem.
(laughs lightly)Ms. Misato.
Oh, boy, am I envious.
It must be nice, livingwith a total hottie like her
and to pilot an Evangelion.
Oh, man, what I wouldn't giveto get in the cockpit
and pilot an Evangelionjust one time.
I wouldn't, if I were you.
I'm sure it would worryyour mother.
Uh, that's not really an issue,
because I don't have a mother.
I'm like you, Shinji.
KENSUKE:Hungry? Want some?
SHINJI:Mm-hmm.
(insects chirring)
SHINJI:Do you do this stuff often?
KENSUKE:Hmm? Eh, yeah.
SHINJI:Are you preparingfor guerrilla warfare for real?
KENSUKE:I can't really do muchwith these toys.
I'm just having fun.
(birds singing)
(approaching footfalls)
Uh...
MAN:Shinji Ikari, correct?
SHINJI:Yes, sir.
MAN:We're NERV Securityand Intelligence.
We have orders to escort youdirectly to headquarters,
as per the NERVSecurity Ordinance.
Will you comply?
SHINJI:Yes, sir.
TOHJI:And you just stood there?
You let them take him away?
Give me a break, Tohji.
They were from NERVSecurity and Intelligence.
Those guys were pros.
What's thatgot to do with it?
What, you don't have any ballstucked down in those shorts?
(girls whisper)
Only an idiot would picka fight after sizing him up.
This has nothingto do with my balls.
(latch clicks)
(door hinges creak)
MISATO:It's been a while.
SHINJI:Yes.
MISATO:Do you feel better
after wandering aroundfor the last two days?
SHINJI:Not really.
MISATO:The Eva is ready.
Will you pilot it or not?
SHINJI:Aren't you gonna scold meabout running away?
No, I guess you wouldn't.
It's not likeI'm your family or anything.
So, what happens if I tell you
I've decided I don'twant to pilot Unit 01?
MISATO:Then we'd have to get Reitodoit.
Are you declining?
How could you expect meto do something like that?
I couldn't just leave itall on Ayanami.
Don't worry about it.I'll do it.
MISATO:You don't wantto pilot the Eva?
SHINJI:Well, of course not.
I'm not cut outfor this kind of stuff,
but you and Ayanamiand Ritsuko are.
MISATO:Enough of this nonsense!
It doesn't matterwhat other people think!
If you don't want to do it,then get out of here!
Forget about the Evasand about all of us!
Just go back to your old life!
You're more troublethan you're worth
if you keep acting like this.
(retreating footfalls)
(door hinges creak)
(door closes)
It seemsthat the Third Children
is scheduled to leaveTokyo-3 tomorrow.
Then rewrite Unit 01's datato match Rei.
RITSUKO:But, sir...
GENDOH:Despite the results
from the reactivation trialsof Unit 00,
we will move onto Unit 01 trials.
(Ritsuko grunts)
Reports fromthe Marduk Institute
indicate the Fourth Childrenhas not been located yet.
So, does that meanthat we currently
do not have anyreplacement pilots?
(whirring)
SHINJI:Um, where is Ms. Misato?
I wanted to say goodbye.
MAN: You're no longeran active member of NERV.
Therefore, we cannotshare such information.
(insects buzzing)
(vehicle approaching)
(car door opens)
(car door closes)
KENSUKE:Hey, newbie!
TOHJI:You forgot something!
(groans)Huh?
Um, can I have a second?
Hi. Uh, thank you.
Go on, Tohji.Come on, say it!
(Tohji groans)
So, I'm really sorry aboutpunching you in the face.
Now it's your turn to punch me.
I can't do that to you.
You have to! I can't livewith myself if you don't.
I know, he can bea bit melodramatic,
but if you hitting himevens things out, then why not?
-But I...-TOHJI: Come on!
We don't havea lot of time here.
Okay, just this once.
Great! Let's go!
-(grunts)-Wait!
Huh?
No holding back.
Hmm.
(Shinji grunts)
- (laughs)-(exhales)
-(grunts)-(chuckles)
Hmm. How'd you know I was here?
Just call it a hunch.
After all, we have beenhaving to say goodbye
to dozens of our classmatesrecently.
You know, Shinji, without youaround, sooner or later,
we're gonna have to leaveour homes in this town, too.
Of course, we're not hereto try and make you stay.
We know what it's likefor you to pilot an Eva.
We've seen it.
So, if some jackassever tries to cuss you out,
then I'll take careof him for you!
(music playing faintly)
Don't stand there,looking so down. Come on.
Take care, okay?
TOHJI:You got this.
>?
MAN:It's time.
(Shinji sighs)
>?
(retreating footfalls)
(grunts)Enough.
I'm the one who deservesto be hit in the face!
(grunts)
I'm dishonest...
a-a coward...
a sneak...
and a weakling.
MAN:Don't make any more trouble.
(retreating footfalls)
WOMAN (over P.A.):Unit 01 will beginLevel 2 cooling cycle
to prepare for configurationdata rewrite.
RITSUKO:He's really gone.
WOMAN:Updating of each program upto Phase 2 should be expedited.
It's for the best, I guess.
The hedgehog's dilemma.
The closer they get,the more they hurt each other.
I get it now.
(dialogue inaudible)
That kid,he mouthed off like that,
but it's just becausehe doesn't understand
how else to relate to others.
WOMAN (over P.A.):Limited express backupbound for Atsugi

EPISODE 5: REI, BEYOND THE HEART
RITSUKO:Rei Ayanami, 14,the first subject chosen
by the Marduk InstituteResearch Reports,
the First Children.
The designated pilot
of Evangelion ExperimentalPrototype Unit 00.
Her past is a blank slate,all records erased.
MISATO:So, what was the causeof the accident?
RITSUKO:The cause is still unknown.
That said,the first hypothesis would be
that the pilot's mental statewas unstable.
MISATO:Mentally unstable? Rei?
RITSUKO:Yes. For someone like her,it was unbelievably unstable.
MISATO:What happened?
RITSUKO:I have no idea.
Perhaps... No.
MISATO:What? What is it?
RITSUKO:Nothing. It couldn'tpossibly be correct.
WOMAN (over P.A. system):Dismantling of Block-D3is complete.
Please submit all datato the Technology Department
Section One Analysis Team.
Reception broadcastwith Management
will be delayed by ten minutes.
Members of Team Seven,Technology Department,
Section Four...
So, this... this is what
we've been defendingourselves from?
RITSUKO:Impressive.
Except for the core,it looks mostly intact.
It's a near-perfect specimen.
Hey, I can't thank you enough.
Sure. So, what'd youfind out about it?
(rewinding)
(beeps)
MISATO:What's that?
RITSUKO:It's an error code
indicating analysis failure.
You mean, you don't even know
what this thing is?
Well, we do know the Angelsare comprised of material
that exhibit particlesand wave properties
that's similar to light.
But it did havea power source, right?
(sighs) Something like that,but we have no idea
of the principlebehind how it works.
So, you're sayingthe world of the unknown
is getting bigger.
It's one mysteryafter the next.
Take this, for example.
This waveform patternis unique to the Angel.
(Shinji gasps)
Show me.
(whirring)
-Is this...?-Yes.
While the materials thatcomprise it are different,
the signal sequencingand locations
are very similar to human DNA.
There's a 99.89% match.
A 99.89% match?
Once more, I'm remindedof just how superficial
our knowledge really is.
ENGINEER:A little more!Okay! All right!
FUYUTSUKI:So this is the core?
ENGINEER:Yes. The rest degraded,
leaving it tooproblematic for research.
GENDOH:No matter. Dispose of it.
ENGINEER:Sir.
What is it?
Uh, i-it's nothing, really.
It's nothing?
Oh, come on, Shinji.
It's writtenall over your face.
You mightas well be screaming
about how afraid you arethat you want attention.
Well, it's just, I noticed
that Father's handshave burns on them.
What burns?
I'm just wonderinghow he got them.
Burns? I don't know. Do you?
It's from before you arrived.
Unit 00 went berserkduring an activation test.
-You know about that?-Yes.
The pilot was trapped insidein the accident.
You mean Ayanami, right?That was the pilot?
RITSUKO:Commander Ikari saved her.
He forcibly openedthe burning hatch
with his bare handstodoiit.
Father did that?
The scars you saw on his palmsare from that incident.
(onlookers cheering)
(cheering)
Nice! You got this!
-Yeah, come on!-You can do it!
BOY:All right, go, go, go!
BOY 2:In your dreams, pal!
(cheers, laughter)
BOY 3:Oh, nice!
BOY 4:We'll get it next time!
BOYS:Yeah!
(girls chattering)
TOHJI: Get a loadof those bazoongas.
GIRL:Suzuhara keeps staring.It's so gross.
GIRLS (in unison):You can do it!
Hey, Shinji.
Did some girlcatch your eye there, champ?
No. It's nothing.
Ayanami?You can tell us.
It's nothing!
Oh, yeah, sure,but you are acting weird.
Ayanami's bazoongas,
Ayanami's thighs,Ayanami's...
BOTH:...supple calves!
Uh, hey, come on, no.It's not like that.
Then tell uswhat you were looking at.
'Cause I already knowwhat you're thinking.
(groans)
SHINJI: I was just wonderingwhy she's always alone.
-TOHJI: What?-KENSUKE: Aw.
TOHJI: Huh.Now that you mention it,
I don't think she's everhad any friends
since transferring inlast year.
KENSUKE: She's not exactlyapproachable.
TOHJI:Maybe she's secretlya crazy psycho.
-(whistle blows)-COACH: One, two, three...
She's an Eva pilotjust like you, right?
You probably know way moreabout her than we do, yeah?
Yeah, that's true.
Well, we hardly ever talk.
WOMAN (on P.A. system):Eva Unit 01 will commencelevel-three cooling cycle.
Page number six should shut downeach system up to Phase Three.
WOMAN 2:Previous harmonicsand sync tests
return no abnormalities.
All numeric requirementsare fulfilled.
WOMAN:Roger.
Forwarding test resultsto Balthazar.
WOMAN 2:Roger.
WOMAN:The complete range
of entry plug personal data
is being relayed to Melchior.
Sending data now.
MAN:Melchior, roger.Circuits connected.
WOMAN 2:Commencing level-threecooling cycle.
WOMAN:Begin circulation of CBL.
WOMAN 2:Begin operationof water reclamation plant.
MAN:Direct wastewater to Level Twotreatment system.
WOMAN:Protein wallsare in good condition.
No issues from each section.
WOMAN 2:T-minus 1,050 minutes
until Unit 00reactivation test.
(horn blows)
RITSUKO:What on earth is this?
MISATO:It's curry. Duh!
RITSUKO:It's TV dinner food,if you can even call it food.
MISATO:In my house,you'll eat what I eat.
>?
SHINJI:Uh, Ms. Misato?
MISATO:Oh, is it my turn?
(sighs happily) Yes!
Just dump it allin here, please.
You want me to what?
Come on,don't keep me waiting!
Okay.
MISATO:This is so much better,
compared to curry-flavoredinstant ramen, you know.
Mmm-mmm! Let's eat!
I find it's better to add lesshot water than it says to.
(slurping)
>?
(Ritsuko and Shinji groan)
Misato made this, didn't she?
-Yeah.-You can tell?
My tongue could.
How can someone ruinboil-in-the-bag food?
The next timeyou invite me over,
I would prefer if it wasShinji's turn to prepare dinner.
>?
(cooing)
(squawks weakly)
>?
(groans)
(thud)
You should consider moving out
and finding some otherplace to live.
If you stay here,you'll pick up some bad habits
from a certain roommateof yours.
I've gotten pretty used to it.
Did you hear that, Ritsuko?
Never underestimatethe human capacity
to adapt to challengingenvironments.
And besides, moving outwould be... huh?
Shinji, could youget me another?
SHINJI:Yes, ma'am.
Moving would be a real painin the keister.
I mean, he just gothis security card.
Do you know how muchpaperwork that took?
Oh, that's right.I almost forgot.
Shinji, can I aska favor of you?
SHINJI:Sure. What is it?
RITSUKO:This is Rei Ayanami'snew security card.
I was supposedto give it to her today,
but I never got around to it.
Sorry, but could yougive it to her
before you come into HQ tomorrow?
Yeah.
(gulping)
You see something you like?
You just can't take your eyesoff that photo of Rei.
(gasps)It's nothing!
Shinji, that's adorable.
I said, it's nothing!
(giggles)
Your cheeks are turningbeet red!
At least now you can sayyou're on official business
when you go visit her house.
(groans)
Stop making fun of me.
(laughs)You get wound up so easily.
You're so fun to tease!
-Just like you, Misato.-(gasps)
It's just that me and herare both Eva pilots,
but I hardly know anythingabout her, really.
She's a nice girl,but just like your father,
she can be a bit awkward.
She's awkward?Awkward at what?
You know, life.
(clanging and banging)
Vang,
(knocks on door)
Um, hello?
(door hinges squeak)
SHINJI:It's me, Ikari. Hello?
Uh, I'm coming in, okay?
(grunts)
(cautious footsteps)
Are these her glasses?
(curtain rings rattle)
Uh...
(stammering) I, I...
I didn't mean to! I...
(groans)
Aah!
(groans)
Aah!
Uh...
(velps)
(thudding and clatter)
Could you move?
(gasps)
(whimpers)
Aah! I'm sorry!
(gasping)
REI:What is it?
Uh, well,I came here to, uh, uh...
(grunts)
Because I-I...I was asked to...
I... What was it? Card!
Your card was renewed,and, uh,
I brought it here for you.
(gulps)
Yeah, so I was tryingto deliver your, uh...
Ms. Ritsuko said she meantto give it to you,
but she forgot.
It's the truth, really.
I rang the bell,but no one answered.
The door was unlocked, so...
(door opens, closes)
Oh.
(rumbling)
WOMAN (on P.A. system):Access to the Central Dogmais currently available.

SHINJI:Sorry about what happened.
REI:About what?
SHINJI:So, um, isn'tyour reactivation test today?
I hope it goes well...this time, I mean.
Um...
Aren't you afraid, Ayanami,
about piloting Unit 00 again?
REI:Why would I be?
SHINJI:I heard what happened last time,
how you got hurt badly.
I was just wondering if...
Tell me, you're CommanderIkari's son, correct?
Mm.
Don't you have any faith
in the work your father's doing?
Of course I don't!
Not in a father like him.
Mm. Uh...
(grunts)
>?
(air hisses)
GENDOH:Rei, how are you?
Rei...

RITSUKO:The pilot was trapped
inside in the accident.
Commander Ikari saved her.
He forcibly openedthe burning hatch
with his bare hands to do it.

Any superficial attackusing guided munitions,

The boring headand shield machine's diameter

OLDER MAN:Early tomorrow.
Six minutes and 54 secondspast midnight.
PREDICTION FOOTAGEBy then, we supposethat all 22 layers

Time for usto wave a white flag?
It's crossed my mind,but there's something else
I'd like to try first.
FUYUTSUKI:You want to firedirectly at the target

An 8.7% chance of success.
There areno better options, sir.
I have no reasonto oppose this plan.
You may proceed,Captain Katsuragi.
Yes, sir.
Is that really the plan,Operations Chief Katsuragi?
Doesn't it seema bit reckless to you?
What are you saying?It's not reckless.
It's realistically executable

MAKOTO:Okay, but an energy blast
powerful enoughto penetrate an A.T. Field
would have to be at least180 million kilowatts.
We're talking abouta lot of electricity.
Where do you planto get it from?

Yeah, that should be just fine.
The summit of Mount Futago willbe our sniping point.
This operation will beginexactly at midnight.
From this point forward,we will refer to this

Don't be drowsy and come dressedlike how you are now.
(gasps, screams)
(whimpering)
Sorry.
I've been doing nothingbut apologizing lately.
Dinner.
I can't eat it.I'm not hungry.
We have to departin 60 minutes.
Do I... really have to pilotthat thing again?
Correct, you do.
No, I've had enough.
You've never beenscared out of your mind
piloting an Eva like I have.
That's why you think it's okay.
I don't want to go throughthat kind of hell ever again.
Then stay in bed.
Stay?
Yes, I will pilot Unit 01.
Dr. Akagi madespecial preparations
to rewrite Unit 01'spersonal data.
Ms. Ritsuko did that?
Well, Captain Katsuragi
and Dr. Akagi are waitingin the cage,
so I need to go.

RITSUKO:What other option do we have?
There's no time.
SHINJI:But this will work, right?
RITSUKO:In theory.
But until we fire it,we won't know for sure
if the barrel or acceleratorcan handle it.
It's never been tested undersuch extreme amounts of energy.
MISATO:Listen up.These are your roles
and responsibilitiesfor this operation.
-Shinji?-Yes, ma'am.
You will be the gunnerin Unit 01.
Yes, ma'am.
Rei, you are on defensein Unit 00.
-Understood.-Shinji, you're the gunner
because your sync ratewith Unit 01
is higher than Rei's is.
This mission requiresexceptional precision
on the part of the operator.
Positrons are affectedby Earth's rotation,
its magnetic field,and gravity.
They do not travelin a straight path.
You must correctfor these factors.
Do not forget that.
Hit the core and only the core.
-Precision is paramount.-But I've never...
practiced anythinglike that before.
MISATO:Don't worry.
Just follow the instructions.
Pull the triggerwhen the central indicators
and the reticle are lined up.
The machine will do the rest.
One more thing:after firing,
the gun needsto cool and recharge
as well as replace the fuse.
It takes timebefore you can shoot again.
So then, what happensif I miss and the target
-shoots back at me?-Don't even let that
be an option in your mind.
Concentrate on hittingthe target with your first shot.
SHINJI:In other words,I'll be in a real jam.
So then...
I am to protect Unit 01?
MISATO:That's correct.
I understand.
MISATO:It's time.
-Get changed.-BOTH: Ma'am.
(air hissing)
There's a chance we could dieon this mission tonight.
Die? What makes you say that?
(air hissing)
You're not going to die.
Because I will protect you.
>?
Um, Ayanami,why do you pilot your Eva?
Because it's my link.
Your link?
That's right.It's my link.
SHINJI:To my father?
AYANAMI:To everyone.
Ayanami, you're a lottougher than I am.
I'm not.I just have nothing else.
What do you mean,you have nothing else?
It's time. Let's go.
All right then, farewell.

Please don't do that.
Please don't say something like
"I have nothing else,"do you understand?
And don't say something sadlike "farewell"
whenever you walk away.
(soft sobs)
Why are you crying, Ikari?
Please forgive me.
In situations like these,
I don't knowhow to respond or act.
Smiling would be a good start.

EPISODE 7: THE WORKS OF MAN
(rattling)
(sighing)
Uh, good morning.
(yawning loudly)
Morning.
-(fizzes)-(gulps)
(screaming happily)
And with that,I'm ready to start the morning!
Drinking beerinstead of coffee?
Since ancient times,Japanese people have
marked their morningswith white rice,
miso soup, and sake.That is how it's always been.
Maybe for youthat's the case.
Hey, back off.
By the way,one more question.
Do you know whose turn it wasto make breakfast today?
At first it surprised me thatyou weren't married at your age,
but now I understandwhy that's the case.
Oh, I'm sorry, am I too crass?
The sloppiness doesn't help.
Oh, that's enough out of you.
Thank you for breakfast.
Are you really gonna cometo school today?
Well, of course I am.
I need to discuss your future.
But you're justso busy with work.
Don't worry about it.This is part of my work, right?
I'm part of your work?
Uh...
(intercom chimes)
MISATO:Morning! Oh...
Thanks again for coming.
Well, he'll be right with you.
Ms. Misato, can you please
not greet themdressed like that?
-It's embarrassing.-Well, okay.
BOTH:Hey, Shinji! Good morning!
Good morning, Ms. Misato,we're off to school!
Have a great day.
(whimpering)
All right, let's go.
(fizzes)
Sarcasm, huh?
Well, he seems to beletting his hair down a little.
That's a good sign.
(dialing)
(line ringing)
-MAN: Yes, ma'am?-He just left the apartment.
Maintain security detail on him.
(buzzing)
(motor revving)
(tires squealing)
-(clamoring)-She's here!
-(bell glissando)- (boys moaning)
BOY:Man, who's that hottie?
BOY 2:She's Ikari's guardian?!
BOY:Are you kidding me?
Ikari gets looked after by her?!
What idiots.
-(beeps)-(Tohji sighs nervously)
TOHJI:Ms. Misato is so damn cool!
Go on.
Plus, she's NERV'soperations director.
-Freakin' amazing!-I don't know.
-BOTH: Hmm?-Ah!
TOHJI:Aren't we lucky, Kensuke?
Shinji's so clueless.
KENSUKE:Yeah, we don't have to worryabout him getting in our way.
SHINJI:They say that now,but they don't know
how much of a slob she can be.
Man, I wish I could hook upwith a girl like her.
It's not what you think.
BOTH:You are one thick dude.
BOTH:All right, it's official,you're in charge
of saving Earth,and we'll be in charge
of taking careof Ms. Misato!
MAYA:Readings indicateUnit 01's cooling
has met prescribed values...
SHINJI:That's what the Evas are for.
Keeping Earth safe.
But what are the Evas?
I smell blood in the entry plug,
and yet I feel calm and secureinside it.
Basically, I have no ideawhat's going on.
RITSUKO:Are Unit 00's organicchest sections ready?
MAYA:They were completely wrecked.
We're making new ones,but that'll eat up
the rest ofthe supplemental budget.
RITSUKO:I wonder if things willimprove a little at least
once Unit 02from Germany arrives.
MAKOTO:Or it could be the opposite.
Taking care of the Angel'smess on the surface
takes up money as well,doesn't it?
MISATO:It's amazing how this place isso starved for funds.
I mean, we are the last hopefor mankind, aren't we?
RITSUKO:What can you do?
Man does not live by Eva alone.
Funds still have to bedirected to the people
we're trying to protect, too.
MISATO:Budget issues, huh?
So that means the commanderhas more meetings?
RITSUKO:Yep. He's on his way there now.
MAYA:Honestly, I likehow things are calmer
when the commander's not here.
MAN:Excuse me.Do you mind if I sit here
since we're traveling together?
The budget adjustmentfor the sample recovery
passed without delay.
GENDOH:The council placesgreat importance
on ensuring their survival.
It tends to loosentheir purse strings.
MAN:Their previous arguments wererooted in their contention
that the Angelswouldn't reappear.
Ah, more good news.
All council nations,except the United States,
have approved the fundingfor Eva Unit 06.
But I'm sure that soonthe U.S. will agree.
They're deathly afraid of highunemployment rates, aren't they?
And your nation?
MAN:We'll participatein Unit 08's construction.
After all,phase two of the buildup plan
is still in effect.
Although we do havethe problem of finding
a suitable pilot.
GENDOH:The angels have returned.
Our only chance for survivalis to defeat them.
Yes, agreed.I would also
rather not havethe Second Impact repeat itself.
SHINJI:So, does that meanthe vaporization
of the Antarcticin the Second Impact was...
RITSUKO: Yes, most textbookssay it was a tragedy
caused by the impactof a massive meteor.
But truth has a tendencyto get covered up.
15 years ago,humanity first discovered
15 years ago,humanity first discovered
a humanoid objectthey referred to as an "angel"
in the Antarctic.
During the investigation,there was a huge,
unexplained explosion.
That's the true causeof the Second Impact.
So, then whatwe're trying to do is--
Prevent the occurrenceof a Third Impact,
which is predicted.It's the reason
NERV and the Evangelionseven exist.
Oh, by the way,I heard something was
taking place tomorrow.
Right, got it.
(birds chirping)
(squawks)
Good morning.
(gasps)Good morning to you.
I'm heading to Old Tokyofor work today.
I'll be home late,so go ahead
and order dinner, 'kay?
Uh... yeah.
DERELICT ZONE NO. 28 (CITY CENTER OF OLD TOKYO)
(distant jet whoosh)
It's hard to imaginethis place used to be
a thriving,bustling metropolis.
RITSUKO:We're here.
MISATO:Why are they having it here,of all places?
(gasp) Wait, is the SSDFinvolved in this project?
The StrategicSelf-Defense Force?
No, there's no signof their involvement.
So that's why they canget away with this.

SHIRO: Thank youfor taking the time
out of your busy schedules
to attend this demonstration
NERY por?
by the Japan Heavy and ChemicalIndustries Consortium.
by the Japan Heavy and ChemicalIndustries Consortium.
We appreciate you coming.
Everyone will be invitedto watch the open trials
of our new achievementfrom the control room.
But before that, are thereany questions from the audience?
-RITSUKO: Yes.-Well, isn't it
-RITSUKO: Yes.-Well, isn't it
the world-famousDr. Ritsuko Akagi?
We are honoredby your presence here today.
I appreciate that,now may I ask my question?
SHIRO:(laughs) Please, by all means.
RITSUKO:You've stated thatyour unit has an internal
heat engine setup.Is that correct?
Yes, that's our unit'sbig advantage.
It's guaranteed to beoperational continuously
for 150 days.
RITSUKO:Well, I believethat equipping a reactor
inside a land battle weapondesigned to engage
in close-quarters combatposes too much of a risk
to the safety of civilians.
It's more usefulthan a weapon that becomes
incapacitatedafter five minutes.
It's difficult to addressemergencies via remote control.
SHIRO:I believe this approach ismuch more humane
than burdening pilotsand putting them at risk
of psychological trauma.
Please stop,you're making a scene.
RITSUKO:And deliberateoperator malfeasance?
I still thinkthis is much safer
than the weaponsyou lose control over,
which then threaten everyoneby going berserk.
Weapons that cannot beadequately controlled
are utter nonsense--they are much like
hysterical women, unfortunately.
- (laughter)-There's not muchyou can do with them.
Pilots and technology are thereto counter those issues.
Are you actually claimingthat science and the human heart
can hold back those beasts?You must be joking.
No, I am not joking.
SHIRO:Relying on somethingas enigmatic
as the human heart iswhat caused
that previous rampageon NERV's watch.
An incident that causedthe United Nations
to foot a huge bill.
Now, a nation's populationis starving,
and 20,000 people could die,and even with a grave incident
such as this,the cause remains a mystery.
I would've hopedyou could fulfill your duties
as the ones entrustedwith our protection.
But isn't it nicehow NERV enjoys
extralegal protectionso you don't have
to take responsibilityfor your failings?
You can say whatever you like,
but NERV's main weapon system
is the only wayof defeating these threats.
Oh, the A.T. Fields?
The issue with the A.T. Fieldswill be resolved soon enough.
NERV's claim to the thronewon't last forever.
(audience clapping, laughing)
-(thuds)-(Misato grunting)
-(thuds)-(Misato grunting)
Those dumb stupid jerks.
Just a bunchof ignorant pigs! (huffs)
They're just jealousand pissed because they were
left out of the operation.
Ooh, they're driving meup a wall!
(grunting)
Please stop.You're making a scene.
Full of hot air and boastful.He just wants praise.
It's really rather patheticfor a man.
How did a sniveling idiotlike him even know
about the A.T. Fields anyway?
Our confidential intelis leaking.
The Intelligence Departmentneeds to do their job.
(beeps, whirring)
(beeps, whirs)
SHIRO:We will now beginthe activation test
of the J.A.
There is no risk of danger.
I assure you,you're completely safe
as you watch from the window.
WOMAN:Ready for activation.
MAN:Begin the test.
All power systems, engaged.
(overlapping voices)
MAN:Withdraw control rods.
MAN 2:Reactor has gone critical.
MAN 3:Power output is normal.
Begin walk cycle.Walk, forward slow.
Start right foot.
ATTENDANT:Roger, walk, forward slow.
Start right foot.
Start right foot.
(heavy thud)
-MAN: Balance is stable.-MAN 3: Power remains stable.
ATTENDANT:Roger. Continuewith left foot forward.
Steady as she goes!
Hey... the thingthey built can walk.
I suppose that's somethingto brag about.
(beeps)
-What is it?-There's something wrong.
The reactor interior pressuresare rising.
ATTENDANT:Primary coolant looptemperatures rising.
Open the valves and ejectthe moderators immediately.
It's not working!Coolant pumping rate
is not rising!
Not good. Power down the unit.Emergency shutdown.
ATTENDANT:Shutdown signal has been sent.
MAN:Signal not being received.
MAN 2:Communication circuits down!
ATTENDANT:We've lost control!
That's not possible.
(technicians clamoring)
(all shouting)
(coughing)
Apparently, that robot is
just as rude as its creator.
(alarm buzzes)
MAN:Abnormalitiesin pressurizer!
ATTENDANT:Control rod mechanism failed!
ATTENDANT 2:At this rate, we're in dangerof a core meltdown!
I-I can't believe it.
The programmingfor J.A. was designed
so that it would be ableto self-address
any and all errors while in use.
This situation isan impossibility.
Great, but we'recurrently in danger
of an imminentcore meltdown, right?
It appears that way,
but there isnothing for us to do.
It has to shut down on its own.
And what'sthe probability on that?
.00002%.It'd take a miracle.
I'd rather go for brokethan stand around waiting.
Tell me how to shutthat thing down.
SHIRO:We've already tried everything.
No, there must bea final resort command,
even if it wipes everything out.
So give me the password for it.
I can't. The master passwordis top secret.
I don't have the authorityto release that information.
Then get the authorityto do so, right now!
-(ringing)-Uh, yes, it's me.
Get me Mr. Manda at Tokyo-2.
Yes! The Home Ministry Director.
MANDA:Yes, I've placed Yasagiin charge of that.
Go ask him.
Ah, a decision of this magnitude
can't be made over the phone.
Can I have a formal requestin writing?
So then, if I get permission
from Mr. Yoshizawa,you'll approve?
Yes, I have gotten
Mr. Uitsu's approval already,yes, thank you.
They're all passing the buck.
The official orders willarrive here soon,
and we willcarry this out properly.
That answer's not good enough!
It's pointlessif that thing explodes
before they arrive!
(alarm buzzes)
WOMAN:Jet Alone is currently heading
toward Atsugi.
There's no time left.
I will unilaterally take actionof my own accord.
Excuse me.
Ah, Hyuga, I've alreadyworked it out with Atsugi,
Ah, Hyuga, I've alreadyworked it out with Atsugi,
so send Shinjiand Unit 01
with Type F equipmentfor deployment.
Yeah, it's an emergency.
You know this is futile,Captain Katsuragi.
How exactly are youplanning on stopping it?
By good old-fashionedhuman touch.
-You cannot be serious.-I am.
By now, the interior must befully contaminated.
It's way too dangerous.
It's our only optionto keep everyone safe.
You should be ableto manually open the hatch
once we interruptthe command signal.
You'll be ableto access the inside
through the backpack rig.
SHIRO:"Hope."
That's the passwordfor complete deletion.
Thank you for that.
Our target is the J.A.There's danger it'll suffer
a reactor meltdownwithin five minutes.
That means we have to make surethat we stop it from getting
any closer to populated areas.
-Hyuga!-Yes, ma'am?
Once the Eva has beendetached from you,
you are to pull backto a safe altitude, understood?
-Roger.-Now, Shinji.
-Ma'am.-You will runalongside the target
and attach me to its upper back.
After that,try to stall the J.A.
any way you can, okay?
Wait, Ms. Misato,you're getting inside it?
-That's right.-But that's insane.
Yes, I know,but we don't have another option
-available to us right now.-No! This is too dangerous!
Don't worry.You'll be fine in your Eva,
even if the blasthits you directly.
I didn't mean me!It's dangerous for you.
Well, sometimes you gotta dowhat you gotta do.
You wouldn't want to livewith regrets.
I have a direct visualon the target.
Okay, time to go.
-Release docking lock!-Roger!
-We've caught up to it.-We've got less than
four minutes to spare.Get me on top!
Set me down now. Let's go!
-(screams)-Ms. Misato!
(sighs) Be careful.
Wow, that's hot.
This doesn't look good.
You are not going anywhere!
Ms. Misato, please hurry!
This has to be it.

(beeping)
The program must havebeen tampered with.
There's no otherexplanation for this.
(gasps)
(gasps)
(alarm buzzing)
ATTENDANT:Reactor will hitprompt criticality at 0.2.
ATTENDANT 2:The control rodsaren't activating!
All right then--one last chance.
(straining)
(straining)
(loud hissing)
You gotta get out, right now!
Come on, move it, damn you!
Ms. Misato!
(straining)
ATTENDANT:0.1 until prompt critical!
ATTENDANT 2:Too late, it's gonna blow!
Oh. We failed.
-Ms. Misato!-(straining)
(beeps)
ATTENDANT:She did it!
ATTENDANT 2:Interior pressure down!
MAN:Readings at default values.
(laughter, cheering)
She did it! Yes! We did it!
What a fool.
SHINJI:Ms. Misato,are you all right?
Are you there?
Yeah, feel like crap,but I'm good.
Are you okay?I can't believe it.
I'm so glad, I was so worried.
You were amazing!
I was wrongabout what I said before.
-You just made a miracle happen!-Yeah.
MISATO:A miracle that was prepared.
By someone.
RITSUKO:Unit 01 has beensafely recovered.
There was no dangerof contamination.
Aside from Captain Katsuragi'sinterference,
-it went according to plan.-Good work.
(birds chirping)
Oh, good morning.
-(fizzes)-(gulping)
(screaming happily)
(sighs)
Next up, a nice warmmorning shower.
Now, where aremy bra and panties?
(intercom chimes)
BOTH:Good morning, Shinji!
Good morning.
I'm heading out now!
Yep, have a good day!
TOHJI:Ugh, man,you gotta love her.
KENSUKE:She is so cool.
SHINJI:That's what I thought, too.
But she's embarrassing at home.
She's sloppy, she's ditzy,
and she's a complete slob.
I can't stand watching heract like that.
KENSUKE:Man, I'm so jealous.
Huh? Why do you say that?
You really don't understandanything, do you?
-You can say that again.-Why is that?
You see her as she really is,
not the imageshe puts up, right?
That's what families do.

Correct. That issue has beenresolved with the council,
and it's all been arranged.
The package departedfrom Sasebo yesterday
and is currentlysailing the Pacific.
(helicopter blades thrumming)
KENSUKE:A MIG-55D transport chopper.
Never in a million years
did I think I'd get to ridein one of these babies.
Man, is it greatto have wonderful friends
-in this world, right, Shinji?-Huh?
Spending all your timesurrounded
by the same old mountainsmust stress you out.
I figured a little dateon a Sunday
might be a nice thing for you.
(gasps) Ms. Misato,
you're seriously gonna goon a date with me today?
What do you thinkabout this hat?
I got it just for youand wore it backwards.
You like it?
So where are we going?
For an extravagant cruisein the Pacific on a deluxe boat.
Wow! Five carriers,four battleships, a huge fleet!
Man, is it greatto have friends like you.
Aw, you call those"deluxe boats"?
KENSUKE:Totally, utterly deluxe.
That's the U.N.'sfull-fledged fleet carrier,
Over the Rainbow.
Wow. It's huge.
I'm amazed a relic like thatmanages to stay afloat.
Come on, now.It's a sweet vintage ship
from the pre-Second Impact era.
CAPTAIN:(scoffs) Those smug snots.
They brought the plugfor their favorite toy.
Kids on an errand.
>?
KENSUKE:Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy!
Any guy in his right mind wouldbe super stoked to be here!
(gasps)
(laughs) Oh, boy!
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy,oh, boy, oh, boy.
(whoops) Oh, boy!
(yelps) G-Get back here!
(yawns)
(groans)
TOHJI:Stupid wind!
Stop right there! Get back here!
(laughs)
-(winces)-GIRL: Hello, Misato.
-How are you doing?-(growls)
Not bad. My, you'vegrown taller, haven't you?
Yep. Not only that.
Other parts of mehave bloomed as well.
Without further ado,please allow me to introduce
Eva Unit 02's pilotand the Second Children...
Asuka Langley Soryu.
(wind blowing)
(slaps echo)
(slaps echo)
(slaps echo)
(slaps echo)
What the hell's that for?
(Kensuke groans)
Your price for the treat.
I think you got a great deal.
Oh, really? That's nothin'.
I'll show you a treat.
(shrieks)
-(slap)-How dare you?!
So, who's the Third ChildrenI've heard about?
It's not going to be you.
No, it's not him. It's him.
Hmm. He seems like an oaf.
CAPTAIN:Well, well.
I mistook you for a tour guideescorting a bunch of Boy Scouts,
but it looks likeI was mistaken.
I stand corrected.
I appreciate you beingso understanding, Captain.
No, no. The honor is mine.
-(Kensuke squealing)-It's been such a long time
since I've been askedto babysit a bunch of children.
Thank you very muchfor your cooperation
in transporting Eva Unit 02.
And here are the specifications
for the emergencyelectrical plug.
(scoffs) I'll tell you right now
that I have no intentionof letting that giant doll
move about on the high seas.
This is merelya precautionary measure,
just in case of an emergency.
We, the Pacific Fleet,are here escorting you
-just in case of an emergency.-KENSUKE: Oh, boy. Oh, boy...
And just when didthe U.N. forces
-become a delivery service?-Oh, boy. (swooning)
-I believe the establishment...-Too cool!
...of a certain agencyhad something to do with it.
SAILOR:Steady as she goes.
CAPTAIN:Quite the escortto ferry about one toy.
The entire Pacific Fleetwas called up.
MISATO:Given the importanceof the Evangelions,
I'd say this isn't enough.
Now if you couldplease sign this.
Back off.Eva Unit 02 and its pilot
were entrusted to usby Germany's Third Branch.
You can't boss us around.
Then when will youhand them over to us?
OFFICER:After they've been unloadedin New Yokosuka.
The high seas are our domain.
You will accept our authority.
-Understood.- (folder snaps shut)
However, please do be mindful
that our command authoritysupersedes yours
in times of hostilities.
Such a badass.
Just like Ms. Ritsuko.
RYOJI KAJI:You're as valiant as ever.
-Hmm?-(gasps) Mr. Kaji!
-Hey.-(gasps)
CAPTAIN:Kaji, I don't rememberinviting you to the bridge.
KAJI:Pardon my bad manners.
MISATO:Then we will excuse ourselves.
TOHJI:You're calling this a date?
-MISATO: I'll entrust you...-So cool. So cool! So cool!
Shit. So they're sayingthose children will save us all?
Apparently, the timeshave changed.
It's my understandingCongress has high hopes
for those robots as well.
Pinning them on those toys?Damn imbeciles.
All that money they're wastingwould be better spent on us.
(power surges)
MISATO:Just what the hell areyou doing here anyway?
Escorting Asuka.
The German branch sent me out.
(sighs) How could I be so dense?
Of course they did.I should have seen this coming.
GIRLS:Hey! Don't youtouch me like that!
BOYS:It's not on purpose!
WOMAN (over P.A.):Flight 03 has departedas scheduled.
So you going outwith someone, Misato?
I don't see any reasonwhy that would concern you.
-Whoa. That's rather cold.- (scoffs)
So I hear you and Katsuragiare living together.
Uh, well, yeah.
Does she stillmake a fool of herself
-when she's sleeping?-(chairs rattle)
CHILDREN:What?!
(Misato gasping)
How dare you?!What are you talking about?!
She hasn't changed,right, Shinji Ikari?
(sighs) Well, no.
Wait. How did you knowwhat my name was?
Come on. Of course I do.
After all, you're pretty famousin this business of ours.
Successfully operating an Evawithout previous training,
our Third Children.
(chuckles)No, that was just a coincidence.
KAJI:Coincidences are a part of fate.
You're blessed with a talent.
-Well, I'll see you later.-Yes, sir.
This isn't happening.It's a nightmare.
KAJI:So what do you thinkof Shinji Ikari?
ASUKA:Quite the letdown.
I never imagined someone asboring as him would be chosen.
I understand, but, you know,
his sync rate hit 40during his very first battle.
You're kidding!
Got to say, that captain
was being a real prick to you.
He's probablyjust a prideful man,
so he expresses himselfwith a few snide remarks.
Mr. Kaji seems funand interesting.
Is he a nice guy?
He hasn't changed at all.
Damn moron.
-ASUKA: Third Children!- (grunts softly)
You come with me for a sec.
Oh. So Unit 02 is red.I had no idea.
Well, that is not the only thingthat makes it special.
Unit 00 and 01are just the prototype
and Test Type builtas part of the development.
The fact that you wereable to sync with yours
without any training proves it.
But Unit 02 is different.
It's the world'sfirst real Evangelion
built for combat operations!
It's the official Eva.
-(rumbling)-Whoa. What was that?
-(stammering)-Underwater shock wave!
That explosion was close.
(gasps)
Is that a...
An Angel? Out here?
For real? That's an Angel?
What do we do?
We should get backto Ms. Misato right away.
(chuckles)
My chance.
-(alarm blaring)-OFFICER: All ships,evasive action.
Be aware of each other.
And where's my damn sitrep?!
SAILOR:Cymbeline is dead in the water!
The Titus Andronicuscannot locate target!
Damn it.What the hell is going on?
NERV rep at your service.
Care for some intelon the unknown enemy
and how to effectivelydeal with it?
We're engaged in combat.
Bystanders aren'tpermitted on the bridge.
This is justmy personal opinion,
but it looks likean Angel attack.
CAPTAIN:All ships free to engage target.
-Roger.-That's a waste of time.
That'll never work.
It's not gonna be enoughto defeat an A.T. Field.
Why would an Angelattack out here?
Is it after Unit 02?
SHINJI (yelps):Where are we going?
(Asuka panting)
Stay here and wait for me.
What is the deal with her?
(suit stretching)
(shrieks) Stop peeking,
-you stupid lech!-I'm sorry!
Why is it all boys are idiots
and so horny all of the time?
(sighs)
-(click)-(whoosh)
Asuka, go get 'em.
Why can't we sink it?
TOHJI:Guess you're prettyhelpless without an Eva.
- (growls)-(gasps)
Huh?
Let's go! Are you ready?
-Uh...-You're coming with!
Is that clear?!
(whimpers)
Hey, so what are we doing
getting dressed uplike this, anyway?
Are you an idiot?
Obviously we're gonna defeatthat thing with my Unit 02.
Is that okay?
Shouldn't we getMs. Misato's permission?
I'll get her permissionafter my victory.
So, I'll give youa front-row seat
SO you can seemy excellent piloting.
But make surenot to get in my way, okay?
(alarm blaring)
How strange.
It seems to be lookingfor something.
Getting attackedby an Angel out here
wasn't part of the deal.
GENDOH:Unit 02 is there to address it.
I even sent you a backup pilot.
- (explosion)-Worst-case scenario,
you should escape on your own.
Understood.
(speaking German)
-(alarm blaring)-Huh?
What's wrong? A program bug?
Cognitive noise.
I thought I told younot to get in my way.
What do you mean?
You're thinking in Japaneseright now, aren't you?
You have to be thinkingin German, you idiot!
Uh, okay, then.
Um, von Kiihen...
Stop! I've had enough!
Change cognitive linguistics.
Set norm to Japanese.
Evangelion Unit 02, activate.
SAILOR:Othello reportsEva Unit 02 has activated.
CAPTAIN:What the...
Nice work, Asuka!
Negative. Abort activation.Stand down now!
-(stammers)-Go ahead, Asuka!
-Launch the Eva!-How dare you?
We have jurisdictionover the Eva and its pilot!
You are to back down now!
(grunts)You've got to be kidding me!
We're in the middleof an emergency right now!
-Your proper protocol...-That would be reckless.
Unit 02 is stillin its type-B configuration.
CAPTAIN:Huh?
Won't we have problems
if we fall in the ocean?
We'll just avoid falling.
Shinji, are youon board Unit 02?
-SHINJI: Yes, ma'am.-Two kids on board?
A test chance, huh?
Asuka, launch now!
-It's here.-Time to go.
(sailors gasp)
-Where is it?-Over there.
(beeps)
We only have58 seconds to do this.
I know that.Misato, have the emergency
external power plugready on the top deck.
I'monit.
What is she planning?
-All right, time to fly.-To fly?
(sailors yell)
MAN:Auxiliary power supply set.
WOMAN:Direct feedto reactor established.
MAN 2:Clear the flight deck now!
MAN 3:Eva, you arecleared for landing.
All stations, brace for impact.
This is absurd.
Eva Unit 02 coming in!
(all gasp)
(squeals) Terrible waste.
MAN:Target fast inbound to O.T.R.
Inbound.Port side, nine o'clock.
Switchingto external power supply.
ASUKA:Switch-over complete.
We don't have any firearms.
The prog knifewill be more than enough.
That thing is huge.
Just as I suspected.
What are they thinking?
Close-quarters combat
is the best wayto defeat an Angel.
(energy surges)
Great job, Asuka!
Are you crazy?!
The flight deck's beenpractically destroyed!
(all yell)
They've gone overboard.
Asuka, you can'tfight underwater
with a type-B configuration.
Who's to say you can't
without actuallygiving it a shot?
(cable grinding)
(crashes echoing)
(cable grinding)
(stammering)
How much cable is left?!
We're down to 1,200.
What are they gonna do then?
They'll figure something out.
-(grunting)-We got to do something fast.
The cable is about to run out.
Brace for impact now!
Oh, no.
MAN:Eva has lost the target!
Chance to swap outthe disk. Come on.
-(machinery whirs)-(gasps) Whoa!
That's a Yak-38lI.
KAJI:Hey there, Katsuragi.
Kaji!
I got to deliver something,
so I'm heading out early.
(stammers)
Let's get out of here.
Take care of things,Captain Katsuragi.
-(camera clicks)-(chuckles)
He made a run for it.
MAN:Target is once againapproaching the Eva!
SHINJI:It came back.
(sighs) He's notgonna get away this time.
(gasps) What is this?!The Eva won't move!
It's "causeit's in the type-B config.
What are you gonna do?!
-What am I gonna do?-Geez, what a wimp.
I thought you were supposedto be the Third Children.
(gasps) It's here.
A mouth!
It's an Angel after all.
MAN:Eva Unit 02 has intrudedinside the target!
TOHJI:Don't you mean it got eaten?
Now this is a lot like fishing.
Fishing? Yes, that's exactly it!
This isn't good.
Now we're stuck in here.
Oh, be quiet!
And get off of me, you lech!
We got to find a wayto get out of here.
MISATO:Asuka, can you hear me?
-Whatever you do, don't let go.-BOTH: Huh?
-Captain.-What is it?
I would like your cooperationon something.
CAPTAIN:Have the twosurviving battleships
fire at point-blank range?
OPERATION PLANMISATO:Exactly. We will makethe two evacuated battleships
submerge alongsidethe umbilical cable.
That sets the trap.
At the same time, Eva Unit 02
will force openthe target's mouth.
Then the two ships' bowswill be inserted,
and, after unleashingdirect fire,
from the forward main turrets,they will self-destruct,
thereby destroying the target.
That plan's insane!
I agree that it might be insane,
but that doesn'tmake it impossible.
Hmm. Fine. Do it.
MAN:All hands, abandon ship.
I repeat:all hands, abandon ship!
MAN 2:All frigates conduct searchand rescue of stranded crew.
But what'll happen with the Eva?
You need not worry.
They'll pull through just fine.
Come on!
Stop messing around,piloting my Unit 02!
Shinji, Asuka,are you okay with the plan?
-(grunting)-We'll make it work somehow.
MISATO:I'm counting on you.
WOMAN:The two battleships'Kingston valves have opened.
They have started descenttoward point Z.
Copy that.Now retract the cable!
(both scream)
MAN:Unit 02 has begun to resurface.
Contact in 70.
Hey! You need to quittouching me like that!
-Get off of me!-But we've got to hurry up
and pry open the mouthright now, or we'll be screwed!
MAN:We'll have contact in 60.
Is the mouth open?
OFFICER:Still closed.
WOMAN:Battleships continuingdescent toward target.
MAN:Unit 02 surfacing!Contact in 50!
It's not working.
And we're out of time.
(grunts)
WOMAN:Target has passed belowthe hull of the Tempest.
MAN:Rate of surfacing accelerating.
You're not gonna make it. Hurry!
Don't getany weird thoughts in your head.
-Why would I?-I'm just saying
what we need to doright now is concentrate.
Yeah, I know.
MAN:Contact in 20!
(both grunting)
Contact in 15!
SHINJI:Open. Open. Open. Open.
ASUKA:Open. Open. Open. Open.
Fire!
(object whistling)
(powering down)
NEW YOKOSUKA (FORMERLY ODAWARA)
NEW YOKOSUKA (FORMERLY ODAWARA)
RITSUKO:That's quite the mess you made.
MISATO:We definitely should have
planned aheadfor underwater combat.
Do I hear contritioncoming from you?
(chuckles) Give me a break.
We got some precious datafrom this.
That's true.
Hmm. Misato.
Hmm?
This really is precious data.
(winch whirring)
(gasps) Dressed like a couple?!
That rubs me the wrong way.
It's a new recordfor synchronization.
Only lasted seven seconds,likely just an adrenaline rush.
(brakes squeal)
Hey! Where's Mr. Kaji?
He ran off ahead of us.
He's probably at HQ already,that jerk.
Got to say that wasquite the tumultuous voyage.
I wonder,might this be the cause?
(snaps clicking)
(case depressurizes)
This is as far asthe restoration has proceeded.
Although it's encasedin solidified Bakelite,
it's alive. We're certain of it.
Human Instrumentality Project'sintegral component.
GENDOH:Correct. The first human being.
This is Adam.
-(school bell chiming)-(boys laugh)
Man, even thoughshe was a hottie,
I couldn't stand her at all.
Well, at least the two of us'llnever have to see her again.
Too bad our buddy herehas to work with her.
I really sympathizefor you, man.
-(door slides)-Eh?
(gasps)

-Wait. See who?-That new foreignexchange cutie. Who else?
-She's foreign?-(camera shutter snapping)
Yeah.Transferred here last week.
She's in the eighth grade,class A.
You gotta check her out.
She's, like, really hot.
-(students cheering)-I think her name
-(students cheering)-I think her name
is Asuka Langley Soryu.
Even her name is hot.
So she's foreign, right?
Do foreign girls mature earlyor something?
No, you moron. She probablyhad to break up with some dude
before she left Germany.I bet she's ready to rebound
with some new,exotic foreign guy.
(boys moan)
KENSUKE:Bunch of saps.
All day, every day,same thing.
"Asuka this. Asuka that."
(sighs) They've got no idea.
Come back soon.
I get she looks goodin a photo,
but that's 'causeyou can't see her personality.
ASUKA:Hallo!
-Hey, Shinji!-(gasps)
Guten Morgen.
G-Guten Morgen.
Is there ever a timeyou're not gloomy?
It's morning, and here I wasnice enough to say hello,
so you should be feeling elated.
-(winces)-Boop.
(sighs) Where's the other one?
-She's here, right?-Other one?
What kind of idiot are you?
I'm talking aboutthe First Children, obviously.
Oh, Ayanami.
(footsteps approaching)
Hallo.
So you're Rei Ayanami,the pilot of the prototype.
Nice to finally meet you.
My name is Asuka.
I'm the pilot of Eva Unit 02.
-You and I should be friends.-Why is that?
Because things'll be smootherif we're friends.
That's the reason why.
If I'm ordered to,I'll be a friend.
You're a weird one.
Gotta say, I'm starting to think
only weirdoesget chosen to be Eva pilots.
(beeping)
(typing)
(footsteps approach)
(gasps)
-You've lost weight.-Have I?
It's becauseyou're tragically in love.
Tragically?
A bold claim. Tell me more.
I know this, because a woman
with a mole in the pathof her tears
means that she will be destinedto cry all of her life.
Are you trying to seduce me?
Now's not the time, dear.
There's a crabby-looking womanstaring right at us.
(exhales)
Been a long time, Ryoji.
It has, hasn't it?
You look a little shaggierthan I remember.
(door whooshes)
Well, I don't thinkhe's changed one bit.
You were here to overseethe handover of Unit 02,
which is complete,so go home already.
Orders came in this morning.
Until further notice,I'm to stay right here.
We'll be seeinga lot more of each other.
Just like old times, huh?
I do not wantto see more of you.
(alarm blaring)
An Angel.
MAN:Cruiser Haruna has sentthe following dispatch.
"Large submerged objectencountered off the coast
of the Kii Peninsula.Relaying data."
Performing analysison the data.
Wavelength Pattern Blue.
Target's an Angel.
All right.Condition One battle stations!
EPISODE 9: MIND, MATCHING, MOMENTEPISODE 9: MIND, MATCHING, MOMENT
MISATO:The interception capabilities
of Tokyo-3 were severely damagedin the last battle.
Currently they'reat 26% of their effectiveness.
As such, their use in combatwould be negligible.
For that reason, we aregoing to strike the Angel down
in one swift blowbefore it hits land.
Unit 01 and Unit 02will take turns
engaging the targetin succession
through close-quarters combat.
BOTH:Roger.
How lame.
This is my debut battlein Japan.
Why doesn't Misato let mehandle this Angel on my own?
What can you do?
It's her plan, after all.
(inhales)Let's get one thing clear.
The minute we're out there,you better not get in my way.
-Got it?-G-Got it.
Why was someone like thatchosen to be a pilot anyway?
Two against one isn't very fair.
I don't like it. Not my style.
We don't have the luxury
of choosinghow we fight our battles.
This is a fight to survive,remember.
(gasps) It's here.
Commence attack.
Right. I'm going in first.
You can cover me.
Hey, hold on.
ASUKA:Ladies first.
(scoffs) You don'thave to be so bossy.
Besides, I was here first.
-He's mine.-Wait!
(shrieks)
She did it.
You see that, Third Children?
You've got to be gracefuland efficient in battle.
-(gasps)-Huh?
No fair! That's cheating!
(whirring)
ANNOUNCER:At 10:58 and 15 seconds a.m.,
Target Alpha, one halfof the original target,
attacked Unit 01.
Unit 01 crashed in Suruga Bay
two kilometersfrom the shoreline.
Five seconds later,Unit 02 was neutralized
by an attack from Target Bravo.
The following is a statementby the director of Project E.
RITSUKO:Appalling.
Verdammt!My first battle in Japan
got all screwed up because youhad to get in the way.
What are you talking about?This happened
because you were too stupidto follow the plan.
I'm stupid?! That's real fresh
coming fromsome good-for-nothing
who hasn't got any balls!
Come on! You were too eager,
and that's why thisturned into such a huge mess.
Just look at that! You looklike you drowned. Shameful!
-Asof 11:03 a.m....-I don't knowif you noticed,
-but you didn't look any better.-...NERV aborted any furtheroperational activities.

28% of the targetwas incinerated.
-ASUKA: It's dead?-FUYUTSUKI: It only delayed it.

REPORT: NERV SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ANALYSIS DEPARTMENTRESEARCH BUREAU SECTION 2
Well, at leastit bought us some time.
I guess it's not all bad news,now, is it?
Answer this question.
What is the jobyou are entrusted with?
-Piloting the Evas.-Wrong.
It's defeating the Angels.
NERV doesn't existfor the purpose
of making a foolout of ourselves!
And to that end,you two need to cooperate.
BOTH:With someone like this?!
That's enough.
(lift whirring)
What's he gotto be so upset about?
Well, adults don't likebeing humiliated.
Um, where's Ms. Misato?
She's on cleanup duty.In the end,
the person in chargehas to take responsibility.
Complaints and damage reports
from government agenciesinvolved.
Oh, and I've also gotthe bill from the U.N. here
and the officeof public affairs complaints.
-(groans)-Make sure you read each one.
I already know what they want.
They want us to fightthe Angels in Tokyo-3.
Very perceptive.
MISATO:Once that wreckis taken care of,
we'll bring the fight here.
Make no mistake.That Angel is going down.
Well, the deputy commander'sfurious.
I'm sure if something like thiswere to happen again,
you'd be demoted.
I guess I'm just lucky
Commander Ikari wasn't hereto witness this disaster.
You'd have been firedon the spot if he was.
He wouldn't needto see the complaints.
Yes, but I suspectyou have a great idea
that just might savemy keister.
Just the one.
Dr. Ritsuko Akagito the rescue.
It's so nice to be ableto count on kind old friends.
I'm flattered,but I'm not the one
who devised the solutionto save my old friend.
The real creditbelongs to Ryoji.
The real creditbelongs to Ryoji.
Ryoji?
-(insects chirping)-(truck motor humming)
DHUArta Moving CenterDHUArta Moving Center
I'm home.
Not that anyone is aroundto hear me say that.
(velps)
What is this crap?!
ASUKA:Don't be crude.
That crap happens to be mine.
S-Sorry. Uh, what are youdoing in my apartment?
I thoughtyou would have left by now.
Left? Uh...
Didn't you get the memo?You got fired today.
(gasps)
You're lookingat Misato's new roommate.
Honestly, you should haveseen this coming.
I'm just so much betterthan you are.
(sighs) Although I'drather move in with Mr. Kaji.
Hey, why are bedroomsin Japan so small?
Like, what's the dealwith that?
Only half of my stufffits in this crawl space.
(yells)
(yells)
And why do you Japaneseuse sliding doors?
Don't you haveany sense of privacy?
There's not evena lock on this thing.
What kind of house is this,seriously?
Japanese try their best
to be considerateand perceptive of others.
-BOTH: Misato.-Welcome home.
Glad to see the two of youhave already started.
-Started?-Started what?
Prepping for the next operation.
BOTH:What for?
MISATO:In order to defeatthe Seventh Angel,
we will have to deliverone heavy strike
on the split coresimultaneously.
It's the only way.
In other words, it will take
a perfectly coordinated attackfrom the two Evas.
To pull that off, the two of you
will need to be ableto work in perfect unison.
-(Asuka sighs)-So for that reason,
you two are goingto have to live together
under the same roof.
(both gasp)
I refuse!Unrelated boys and girls
of a certain ageshouldn't live together!
The Angel is recoveringas we speak.
It attacks in six days.
There's no time to argue.
Seriously? This is the worst.
I have a trick that willmake this plan possible.
To fully master an attackthat's in perfect unison,
you need to memorizea plan of attack
that's set to this music.
Commit it to memory.
You have six days.
(Shinji sighs)
(Asuka scoffs)
You think Shinji's, like,sick or something?
Maybe. Three daysis a long time to be absent.
Hey, look. It's the class rep.
Two-thirds of the idiot trio.
TOHJI:So, class rep,what brings you here?
I'm here to pay a visitto Miss Soryu.
And what about you two?
KENSUKE:We're here to see how lkari's doing.
ALL:Why are you stopping here?
(chimes)
SHINJI and ASUKA:Just a sec.
(gasps) You dirty traitor.
You guys are dressedlike a couple again.
That rubs me the wrong way.
BOTH:This is something about
how you have to startwith the looks.
Ms. Misato forced us to.
(groans)
You two are being indecent!
BOTH:It's just a misunderstanding.
Yes, I misunderstoodyou being indecent.
MISATO:Your friends are here. How nice.
Hey, can you explainwhat's going on here?
(laughter)
Why didn't youtell us earlier?
-That's freaking hilarious.-(music notes playing)
Well, is itat least working yet?
-Are they in unison?-You tell me.
-Take a look for yourself.-(awkward stepping)
-(all groan)-(buzzer)
This is never going to work.
How am I supposedto lower my abilities
to match this tragicexcuse for a pilot?!
This whole thing is impossible!
So then you want out?
If I quit,there's no one to replace me.
-Rei...-Yes.
-demonstrate.-Yes.
Huh?
-(console beeps)-(music notes playing in unison)
(gasps)
(students gasp)
If you ask me,it might be better
to switch out Asukafor Rei at this rate.
Huh?
(gasps) That's it!
-I've had it with this!-Eh?
Ms. Asuka!
Huh. I guess the devil can cry.
(Hikari growls) Ikari!
-Huh?-Go after her!
Why?
Because youjust made a girl cry!
Take responsibilityfor your actions!
-(entry chime rings)-(cooler humming)
(pop music playing softly)
(footsteps approaching)
-Hey, uh---Don't even bother.
I know what to do.
All I have leftis being an Eva pilot.
(sighs) I'll do it.
ASUKA:We'll show 'em. Misato and Rei
will be totally blown awayby how good we are!
This isn'tabout impressing people.
Why aren't youmore gung-ho about this?
Be a man for once!
I'll show 'em.
They're gonna pay.
No one gets away withtaking a shot at me like that.
(gulping soda)
>?
Two More DaysTwo More Days
Tomorrow's the attackTomorrow's the attack
-Where's Misato?-Work.
Said she'll be there all nightdoing overtime.
Great! Then that means we havethe house all to ourselves.
(pop music playingover headphones)
Huh?
Um...
FYI, this is now
the impenetrableWall of Jericho.
-Uh...-Breaching this wall
will resultin the death penalty.
You should go to bed.Children need the extra sleep.
I'll never understandwhy Japanese people
like sleeping on the floor.Unbelievable.

You're as much of a kid as me.
MISATO:Stop it. People might see us.
-RYOQJI: Like who?-Just wait.
(dial clicking)
(bell dings)
(panting)
You can't do thatto me anymore.
I'm not your girlfriend,and we're not in a relationship.
You say that,
but your lipsdon't seem to agree with you.
-(sighs)-So which is it, then?
Do I trust your lips...
or the wordsthat slip between them?
(elevator whirring)
(sighs)
(grunts)

(footsteps approach)
RITSUKO:Here.
(sighs) Thank you.
Not drinking much tonight,I see.
(grunts) Not tonight.
So is it work or a boy?
Work.
Hmm.
Is the attraction still there?
(gags)
Stop talking nonsense!
Why would I evergo back to him?
(sighs) Beingin a relationship with him
will be an eternal blotchon my life.
I mean, come on.I was young and being stupid.
I meant if Kajiwas still attracted to you.
Huh. Did I scare you?
(growling)
Getting angryonly proves my point.
Why don't you justbe honest with yourself on this?
Things are very differentfrom eight years ago.
You're wrong about that.
It's the same.Still not a grown-up.
Well, I should get back to work.
Tomorrow's the big day.
(engines thrumming)
(heavy footsteps boom)
SHIGERU:The target has breachedthe Gora absolute defense line.
MISATO:Here they come.
But this time,we're ready for you.
Deploy the A.T. Fieldas soon as the music starts.
From there,just follow the plan.
Are you ready?
BOTH:Yes, ma'am!
SHIGERU:The target isbetween the mountains.
Get ready. Once we start,we're going balls to the wall.
It's full speed ahead.
Yeah, I'm ready.
We'll finish thisin 62 seconds.
The target isabout to reach point zero!

And launch.

Not again!

(gasps)
What the hell?!
What do you thinkyou're doing to my Unit 02?!
What are youeven talking about?!
-You're the one crushing me!-You missed your mark
at the very last second.Don't deny it!
As usual, you're justan oaf stomping around!
And what was that last night?You trying to pull a fast one?
SHINJI:I-I was visualizing how I wasgoing to fight today's battle.
You liar! You tried to sneaka kiss while I was asleep!
Uh, what? You werefaking that whole time?!
ASUKA:You admit it!
You actually weretrying to kiss me!
You did kiss me, didn't you?!
Eh, no! I didn't!
I stopped midway!
Pervert! Sex-crazed maniac!
SHINJI:That's not fair!You were the one
that came to mein the middle of the night.

This is a total embarrassmentall over again.

(Asuka humming tune)
This is great!
I didn't think you'd want tocome shopping with me, Mr. Kaji.
KAJI:Uh, hold on a second.
This is the swimsuit section.
What about this one?Do you think it's cute?
I don't know.I think it's a little revealing
for a junior high schoolstudent.
You're behind the times,Mr. Kaji.
Nowadays all the girlswear stuff like this.
They do, huh? I didn't know.
Yeah, and the big school tripIS coming up.
We're gonna have so much funand go crazy.
What's the destination?
ASUKA:Okinawa!
It's gonna be so much fun.
The itineraryincludes scuba diving.
KAJI:Scuba diving?
I think the last timeI dived was three years ago.
Oh, yeah? Where did you gofor your school trip?
Me? Uh, we didn't havea school trip.
But why not?
Because the Second Impacthad just happened.
EPISODE 10: THE MAGMA DIVER
(truck horn honks)
(Pen-Pen sighs)
-ASUKA: What?!-(shrieks)
Are you saying we can'tgo on the school trip?!
-Nope.-And why not?
Because youhave to be on standby.
Well, no onetold me that before.
-I'm telling you now.-And who made that decision?
I did. I'm the operationsdirector, remember?
(sipping)
(scoffs)
Shinji, don't just sit thereand act like you don't care.
Stop sipping tea,and say something.
Grow some balls!
Well, it's justI kind of anticipated
something like thiswould happen to us.
So you're giving up?Is that it?
Mm-hmm.
(sighs) That is pathetic.
There's nothing worsethan a guy that's subservient.
Why do you have to saysomething mean?
I sympathize, Asuka.I really do,
but what choice do I have?
If an Angel attacks andyou're away on a school trip,
-we'd be powerless to stop it.-PEN-PEN: Eh?
SoryuSoryuSoryu
SoryuSoryuSoryu
SoryuSoryuSoryu
SoryuSoryuSoryu
SoryuSoryuSoryu
SoryuSoryuSoryu
and take the fightto them for once?
If we could, we would.Trust me.
Besides, you twoshould think of this
as more of an opportunity.
While your classmatesare away partying,
you'll be able to concentrateharder on your studies.
Or did you seriously think
-you could hide these from me?-(gasps)
-you could hide these from me?-(gasps)
-you could hide these from me?-(gasps)
You can't hideyour test results from me.
It's pointless.
If I wanted to find outhow you're doing in school,
I can easily get grades andtest scores from your teachers.
You realize that.
Grades? Who cares about grades?
At the end of the day,they're meaningless.
All those tests do is punish you
for havingany kind of imperfections.
When in Rome,do as the Romans do.
I need you to get adjustedto school life in Japan.
(groans) No!
I'll bring you backsomething nice, Asuka.
Sorry, guys.Tough luck, I guess.
Yeah. We'll haveto have more fun
to make up for your loss.(laughs)
WOMAN:Please expedite transfer
of Mount Asamaobservational data
from Balthasar to Melchioras soon as possible.
(announcements continue)
(laughs)
(humming tune)
A school trip? Really?
At a time like this?
It's becausetimes are like this
that they want to have funwhile they can get it.
Can you blame 'em?
(water splashes)
(typing)
(footsteps approaching)
ASUKA:What you doing?
Studying for science.
Oh, so you'rethe teacher's pet now?
Sure. Whatever.
I needed to study anyway,so could you...
-(gasps)-Ta-da!
Since I won't bescuba diving in Okinawa,
I'll dive here instead.
Uh, okay.
So what are you going over?
Let me take a look.
Come on. You can't solvean equation like this?
There. All done.
(whimpers)
That was easy.
So wait. If this stuffis so easy for you,
then how come you failedthe test at school?
(sighs) I failed,because I couldn't figure out
what was writtenon those test sheets.
You mean you couldn'tfigure out the questions
that were written in Japanese.
Yep. I haven't learnedall the kanji yet.
I didn't study any of itwhen I was in college back home.
-College?-Yeah.
I graduated last year.
So what does this problem say?
It's a questionabout thermal expansion.
Thermal expansion?
That's, like,elementary school stuff.
Here. I'll give youthe short story of it
in termseven you can understand.
Basically stuff expandswhen it's heated
and shrinks when it's cold.
Yeah, I suppose so.
I wonder if my breastswould get bigger
if I warmed them up.
You think thermal expansionwould make a difference?
How would I know?
Why do you have to beso weird all the time?
How are you so boring?
(footsteps fading)
(sighs)
(metal clinking)
(sighs)
(water splashes)
ASUKA:Hey! Shinji, check it out!
-Hmm?-This is back roll entry!
(sighs)
(helicopter blades whirring)
(projector clicking)
FUYUTSUKI:It's vague at best.
SHIGERU:I concur with the report
by the Mount AsamaEarthquake Laboratory.
This shadow bothers me.
Of coursewe won't disregard it.
What's the Magi saying?
It's 50/50, ma'am.
-Anyone on-site?-Yes.
Captain Katsuragihas already made her way there.
(instruments beeping)
(sonar pinging)
We're at its limit.
Not yet. Go another 500, please.
(winch clanking)
-(material shatters)-(alarm beeps)
WOMAN:Depth, 1,200.
Fissures occurringin the pressure bulkhead.
Ms. Katsuragi!
If it breaks,NERV will pay for it.
Go another 200.
(winch clanking)
We have a reading on the sensor.
-Start the analysis.-Ma'am.
-(rumbling)-(alarm blares)
WOMAN:The probe has been compromisedand imploded.
The analysis?
We just barely made it in time.Pattern blue.
Now we know for sure.It's an Angel.
From this moment on,
the laboratory will becompletely sequestered.
NERV assumes full authority.
No one will be allowedto enter or leave.
All information regardingthe previous six hours
will be treated as top secret.
(alarm beeps)
SEISMIC WAVE ANALYSIS ROOM 1
SEISMIC WAVE ANALYSIS ROOM 1Request an A-17 approval
SEISMIC WAVE ANALYSIS ROOM 1from Commander Ikarion the double.
Please exercise caution.
-This is not a secure line.-Yes, I know.
So switch us overto a secure line right away.
An A-17?
We're going on the offensive?
GENDOH:That's correct.
Too dangerous.We won't permit it.
I won't let you forgetwhat happened 15 years ago.
This is a golden opportunity.
Finally we cantake the fight to them,
rather than sit on defense.
The risk is far too great.
We may be able to capturea live Angel.
I need not expand onthe significance of that feat.
Failure will not be tolerated.
FUYUTSUKI:Failure?
Failure would resultin the decimation of humanity.
Are youabsolutely sure about this?
SHINJI:That's an Angel?
RITSUKO:Yes. It's like a pupa,
an undeveloped stateprior to being fully grown.
Your number one priorityfor this mission
is to capture the Angel.
You are to recover it alive,
with as little damageas possible.
ASUKA:And if we can't?
RITSUKO:Then destroy it immediately.
-Understood?-PILOTS: Ma'am.
This operationwill be handled by...
Let me do it!I want to go diving!
SHINJI:I'll probably get stuckdoing it just like before.
-Asuka.-Huh?
You will do it with Unit 02.
Yay!This is gonna be super easy.
And me?
Unit 00 is a prototype,
and therefore isn't set upfor specialized equipment.
Right. You will stand bywith Unit 00 at HQ.
-Yes.-Oh, you're gonna miss
the hot spring, aren't you?That's a shame.
RITSUKO:A-17 has already been issued,
-so we need to move. Let's go.-PILOTS: Ma'am.
Huh? I thoughtthis was supposed to be
a heat-resistant plug suit.
It seems exactlythe same as the others.
Try the switchon your right arm.
-(sloshing)-Hey.
Hey! Aah!
What the crap is this thing?!
Unit 02 is ready to go as well.
ASUKA:No way!
What have you done?!What is that?!
A suit to withstand high heat,pressure, and nuclear attacks,
localized Type-D gear.
What did they do to you,Unit 02?
That's enough!
I'm not gonna do it!
I cannot be seenout in public wearing this!
Shinji is the onemeant to wear this outfit.
KAJI:Well, that's too bad.
I was reallyhoping I'd get to see
your acts of gallantry at work.
(wails)
I don't want Mr. Kaji to see mein a horrible outfit like this.
It's embarrassing.
MAYA:What do we do?
RITSUKO:Let me think.
Well, if it's a problem,I could...
I can pilot Unit 02 for you.
- (growls)-(slap)
Sorry, but I don't want you
to go anywhere near my Unit 02!Is that clear?!
I'll do it if it meansit'll stop the First.
I know how it looks, but it'sjust for a little while.
Eva Unit 01 and Unit 02have arrived on-site.
Both units areto stand by at the site.
Expedite preparations forthe laser discharge and crane.
Copy that.
MAN:Bridge crane foundation secure.
WOMAN:Beginning cooling systemtest trials.
Hey, wait. Where's Mr. Kaji?
That idiotwon't be here for this.
There's nothing for him to do.
Oh. If he's not here,
he can't see how well I doon this operation.
WOMAN:An A-17 declaration?
That includesseizure of current assets.
I'm sure it'll rub a numberof people the wrong way.
So why didn't you stop them?
Because I don't havea reason to.
They issued that order properly.
However, failureon the part of NERV
will translateinto Earth's doom.
I don't thinkthey're arrogant enough
to let that happen.
(jet engines roaring)
What are those, aircrafts?
RITSUKO:The U.N. Air Force isstanding by above us.
MAYA:They'll be hereuntil the operation ends.
So are they here to help, too?
RITSUKO:Sort of.
They'll clean up after us.
MAYA:In case we fail our mission.
Well, what does that mean?
RITSUKO:They'll incinerate the Angel
using an N2 mine,us along with it.
-How could they?-Who would ever issue
an order like that?It's crazy.
RITSUKO:Commander Ikari would.
(gasps)
WOMAN:Laser firing complete.
MAN:Ingress route clear.
MAYA:Type-D gear good to go.
MAKOTO:Unit 02 is in launch position.
Roger.
Asuka...
are you ready?
Yes. I'm all set.
Launch now.
>?
Wow. That looks really hot.
Eva Unit 02 is nowentering the magma.
-Hey, Shinji, check this out!-Huh?
Giant strong entry!
(sighs)
MAYA:Current depth, 170.
Speed of descent, two-zero.All systems are go.
Visibility is zero.I can't see a thing.
Switching over to CT monitor.

This is the predictedtarget location.
Asuka, do you see anything?
Nothing yet. Scope's clear.
The convection must bestronger than we assumed.
MAKOTO:The target'smovement speed is deviating.
MISATO:Run a recalculation.
Continue the operation.
Restart descent immediately.

WOMAN:Fractures in the circulationpiping number two.
MAYA:Depth, 1,480.
Now exceeding operating depth.
We still have not made contact
with the target yet,so keep going.
-How are you, Asuka?-Holding on for now.
I just wantto get this over with
so I can jump in the shower.
MISATO:There's a nicehot spring nearby.
After this is done,we should go.
Just a little more.
-(material shatters)-(gasps)
MAYA:We are 120 beyondthe operating depth.
-(gasps)-WOMAN: Eva Unit 02
has lost its prog knife.
MAYA:200 beyond the operating depth.
Ms. Katsuragi,we can't go any further!
This time,it's not an unmanned probe!
I'm aware of that, but I'min command of this operation.
Continue descent.
Misato's right.
I'm fine. I could handle it.
Let's keep going.
(alarm chirps)
We've now arrivedat depth 1,780.
This is the new estimatedposition of the target.
There.
>?
MAKOTO:We have a visual of the target.
Prepare for capture.
Asuka, the convection currentsare moving both of you.
You've got one shot.
Capture the target.
No problem. Leave it to me.
MAKOTO:T-minus 30 to contact.
ASUKA:Relative velocity is 2.2.
Locked on trajectory.
ASUKA:Super EM photonscreen deployed.
I've captured the target.
-(gasps)-(sighs)
Nice work, Asuka.
(sighs)
Capture operation's complete.
Now initiating resurfacing.
SHINJI:Asuka, you okay?
Of course. That was easy.
Fear is often worsethan the danger itself.
This was a piece of cake.
But this thing feelsmore like a personal sauna
than a plug suit.
(sighs) Can't waitto jump into a hot spring.
Well, it seemsshe's a lot more relaxed now.
Yeah?
You were anxiousabout this mission,
fearful even.
Yes. Well, if the missionhad gone sour,
you knowwhat would have happened.
That's right,a new Second Impact.
I'd rather avoid that.
-(alarm blaring)-Hmm?
Hey, wait! What's going on?!
(muffled roaring)
It's hatching.
Why does it have to be now?
It's faster than we calculated.
And the holding cage?
MAKOTO:It won't last much longer.
Abandon the capture!
Release the holding cage!
(grunts)
(Angel roars)
I'm changing the mission.
Priority one, destroy the Angel.
Listen up, Unit 02.
Ready withdrawal,and prepare for combat.
It's about time!
Damn it. That's right.
I dropped my prog knifeon descent.
-(alarm beeps)-It's coming!
Jettisoning ballast!
It's quick.
-(alarm beeps)-Crap.
I've lost track of that thing.
I'm practically blind down here.
It's 1,000 degrees.
This suit is sticking to me.Disgusting.
-This totally sucks.-MISATO: Asuka.
Eva Unit 01 will dropits prog knife down to you.
Get ready to grab.
-Roger. Ready.-(alarm beeps)
Crap!
It's now or never, Shinji!
(Shinji yells)
MISATO:Knife arrival in 40.
MAKOTO:The Angel isclosing in rapidly.
Hey, wait! Go away!
Hey, where's that knife?!
Come on!
Why is it so slow?!
You bastard.
Unbelievable. It openedits mouth while in the magma.
Its physiology's unimaginable.
(groans)
MAYA:Left leg damaged!
Isolating intrusion.
Damn you, bastard!
That thing's adapted.
It's usedto the extreme conditions
of intense heatand high pressure.
The prog knifewill be useless here.
If that's the case,what do we do?
-I got it!-I know what to do!
Eat this!
It's genius. Thermal expansion.
Hurry and redirectall remaining coolant pressure
to number three! Do it now!
(yells)
(grunting)
(gasps)
(Angel wails)
But I've come so far.
Is this it? That really sucks.
(gasps) Shinji.
Dummy. You got a death wish.
(bird squawking)

DRIVER:Hello there!
Is there anyone from NERV here?
SHINJI:Just a moment!

Thank you. Have a good one.
SHINJI:From Mr. Kaji?
Wonder what it is.
(squawks)
The baths are on your left.
(percussion echoes)
(squealing)
(sighs) It's paradise on earth.
(cooing)
I never realized taking a bathcould feel this good.
MISATO:Shinji! Are you there?
(gasps) Yes, ma'am!
MISATO:Could you toss oversome body soap?!
ASUKA:We already went through ours.
Sure.
Here it comes.
ASUKA:Roger!
- (splashes)-Ow!
That hurt! What areyou trying to do, moron?
Uh, sorry.
Pay attention where youthrow things next time.
MISATO:Come here. Let me see.
-(Asuka winces)-MISATO (laughs): Wow.
Your skin'sso soft and creamy, Asuka.
ASUKA:Hey, stop! That tickles!
MISATO:(laughs) Fine. What about here?
ASUKA:(squeals) Hey!
That's a no-touch zone!
MISATO:Please. You're too sensitive.
You need to get over it.
(velps)
I can't believethis is happening.
Oh, man.
(birds squawking)
Hmm? What, this thing?
It's from the Second Impact.Something happened.
You know, don't you?
All about me and my past?
Yes. It's my job to know.
All that is in the past now.
We shouldn'tlet it hang over us.

(birds singing)


-(children laugh)
-Look again.


-Let me see.
-Come on.


CHILD:
Oh, yeah! I got it! I got it!


Laundromat
Open 24 Hours


(device buzzes)


(device buzzes)


-Thank you for choosing us.
-The amount of money


we're spending at the cleaners
is not insignificant.


It would be nice if we at least


had enough free time
to wash our own clothes.


At least we got it done.


And now we can head back home.


(train rattling)


TRAIN IS APPROACHING


(brakes squeal)


(brakes hiss)


The Nihon Keizai Shimbun


RITSUKO:
Oh, Deputy Commander.


-(door warning beeping)
-Good morning, sir.


BOTH:
Good morning to you, sir!


Yeah, good morning.


You're up early this morning.


Yes, I was topside in the city
on lkari's behalf.


Right. The council had
their regular session today.


A menial chore.
Damn Ikari likes to shove


all the meaningless drivel
in my direction.


If it wasn't for the Magi,
nothing could get done.


If I'm not mistaken,
the city assembly election


is coming up, isn't it?


The city assembly is a charade.


City management is basically


in the hands of the Magi
at this point.


The Magi? Are you talking about
the supercomputers that we use?


Three linked computers
that decide by majority vote,


built as a system that abides
by the principles of democracy.


So the city assembly simply
approves their decisions?


It's the most efficient


and least wasteful
form of governance.


Wow, a true city of science.


This is an age when science
can solve all our problems.


What a cliché.


So you're busy with Unit 00's
trials today, yes?


Yes. At 10:30, we'll be testing


the Stage Two operational
duration extension system.


I have high hopes
for your success.


(alarm blaring)


Abort the test.
Open all circuits right now.


(powering down)


MAYA:
Circuit switch-over complete.


MAN:
Power being restored.


This must be
where the problem lies.


Yes. It bothers me
how the conversion efficiency


is .08% lower than predicted.


It's just within the margin
of error for our instruments.


So what do you want me to do?


Let's try again, but this time,


lower the inter-conversion
setting by .01.


-MAYA: Roger that.
-All right, then.


Time to begin
the reactivation test.


EPISODE 11: IN THE STILL DARKNESS


(bell dings)


KAJI:
Wait! Hold the elevator!


(running footsteps)


-(grunts)
-(groans)


Huh. Man, did I hustle or what?


Aw, is someone
in a bad mood today?


Yeah, because I saw your face
this early.


-(click)
-Yes, hold the line, please.


(music box tune playing)


(click)
-GENDOH: What is it?


(inhales)


Uh, uh... Father...


What is it? Spit it out.


Uh, well...


today I was told...


at school...


that I should
let you know that--


that guidance sessions
will be taking place and, uh--


I put Captain Katsuragi
in charge of these things.


Don't waste my time
with trivial affairs.


-(static crackling)
-And stop patching through


-calls like this to--
-(click)


Uh...


-(dial clicks)
-(powering down)


-Huh?
-A power outage?


Don't be ridiculous.
That could never happen.


(lighting clunks)


That's strange.


Has there been an accident?


Well, maybe lkagi messed up
one of her experiments.


(powering down)


MAYA:
Main power has ceased.


Power voltage is zero.


(sighs) I didn't do anything.


-What do you make of it?
-Nothing to worry about.


It should switch over
to the backup power feed.


-Get me service...
-MAKOTO: It's not working.


The backup circuits
aren't coming on line!


That's absurd!


Which lines are still active?


WOMAN:
A total of 1.2%!


Only circuit number 2567
is functional!


Reroute all available power


toward maintaining the Magi
and Central Dogma.


But we may lose life support
for parts of the complex.


No matter!
This is priority one!


WOMAN (over loudspeaker):
Aiming for governance
beloved by all, a man of...


WOMAN (over loudspeaker):
Aiming for governance
beloved by all, a man of...


Man, I can't believe how much
of a slob Ms. Katsuragi is.


I would have thought
she'd at least


be able to grab
her own laundry. Ah.


(nearby music stops)


Huh?


-(insects buzzing)
-ASUKA: Who knows?


Maybe Commander Ikari
Was just really busy.


SHINJI:
I don't know.


It seemed more like
some phone malfunction


than Father hanging up on me.


Come on. You're a man.
You've really got to stop


worrying about
little details like that.


Huh?


ASUKA:
What are you doing?


Here. Let me try.


Huh?


(grunting)


(yells) Dang it!


This thing is broken!
What the hell?!


-(metal creaking)
-MAN: Heave.


MAN 2 (straining):
Almost there...


(all yelp)


(footsteps echoing)


Let's hurry
to the command center.


It's very unusual for us to be
out of power for this long.


There's something major
going on.


How is the power set up?


Three lines--
main, auxiliary, and backup.


It's inconceivable for all three
to fail at the same time.


Then that means...


It seems natural
to assume that the breaker


was sabotaged,
as opposed to being tripped.


Our more immediate concern


should be how this will impact
fighting the Angels.


MAN: Tracking radar has picked
up an unidentified object.


Estimated point of landfall
is the former Atami region.


(monitor beeps)


A damned eighth one.


Likely another Angel.


What do we do?


What do we do?


What do we do?


UNIFIED WARNING & CONTROL CENTER


Raise the alert status
for all forces.


UNIFIED WARNING & CONTROL CENTER


-That is the protocol.
-(alarm blaring)


-That is the protocol.
-(alarm blaring)


I bet that thing
is probably going after Tokyo-3.


Most likely. I suppose
there isn't anything we can do.


= TARGET ADVANCE ESTIMATION
Most likely. I suppose
there isn't anything we can do.


(waves splashing)


22ND WARNING GROUP
OLD OMAEZAKI RADAR SITE


MAN:
Sir, the Angel has landed!


WOMAN:
It's moving inland.


Anything from Tokyo-3?


WOMAN 2:
No word yet, sir.


What in the hell
is NERV up to?


I always thought
the gangway ladders


were just
20th-century decoration.


I never imagined
we'd actually have to use them.


- (overlapping chatter)
-MAYA: As they say,


to prepare is to prevent.


(glass squeaks)


(sighs)


This won't budge, either.


REI:
None of the facilities
are working. Strange.


So did something happen
down below?


REI:
That explanation makes sense.


SHINJI:
Well, let's try to contact
NERV HQ somehow.


(sighs) It's no use.


Even the emergency line is dead.


No go.
Line 77 is also disconnected.


It's dead. It won't connect.


This one won't work, either.


Even the emergency ground line
is disconnected.


What do we do?


(gasps)


What are you looking for?


Are you an idiot?!


I'm getting my emergency manual!


Let's just go to HQ.


Agreed. Let's decide on who
should be the group leader


-before we go on the move, okay?
-Uh...


Naturally, I think
I would be the best leader.


Is everyone in agreement?


Right! Let's go.


We can go below


-using this route number 07.
-Hah.


SHINJI:
What if the doors won't open?


A manual release?


Come on, Shinji!


Even you can handle a door.


(grunting) Damn it.


You only come to me


to avoid doing heavy lifting.


WOMAN:
Message from Matsushiro...


Damn Joint Staff Council


only show up when they
need something handled.


What is the government saying?


(scoffs) You mean
the civvies in Tokyo-2?


They're all preparing
to run away.


Prevent Mountain Fires


WOMAN:
The Angel is still
active and advancing.


We need to get in contact
with the people of NERV somehow.


With comms down,
how are we gonna do that?


By going right to them.


MAN (over loudspeaker):
This is the Third District
Air Defense Force.


Currently an unknown object
is approaching this location.


All residents must
immediately make their way


to designated evacuation zones.


Crap. I gotta get
the news to HQ.


Uh...


but how should I...


(vehicle approaching)


WOMAN (over loudspeaker):
Even in times of emergency,


you can count
on Nisoku Takahashi.


Please elect Nisoku Takahashi.


(gasps) That's it!


MISATO:
Boy, it's getting
hot in here, isn't it?


The ventilation shut down, yeah.


Katsuragi, you can probably


remove your shirt
if you're too hot.


-(yelps)
-There's no reason


for you to be embarrassed
around me.


(gasps) I don't care
what situation we're in.


Don't get any funny ideas.


Okay.


This isn't good.


The air in here
is starting to get stale.


(sighs) And to think


this is the most cutting-edge
tech facility.


I'm impressed by the commander
and deputy commander.


They don't seem fazed
by the heat at all.


Lukewarm.


Agreed.


(engine roaring)


WOMAN (over loudspeaker):
Due to a state of special
emergency being declared,


please make way
for this emergency vehicle.


Oh, no! This is a dead end!


Go ahead and bust right through!


-This is an emergency!
-(whimpering)


MAN:
You got it!


WOMAN (over loudspeaker):
Please stop! I want to get out!


FUYUTSUKI:
This Geo-Front was created


to function
like an independent colony


and be completely
self-sufficient.


A situation where all its
electrical power goes dark


is theoretically impossible.


RITSUKO:
Does that mean this blackout
was intentional?


GENDOH:
Someone wants
to investigate this place.


RITSUKO:
They can learn a lot


by surveying how HQ
restores its power.


Annoying troublemakers.


I can have the Magi
run decoy programs


to make it difficult to
ascertain our operations, sir.


-Make it so.
-Yes, sir.


FUYUTSUKI:
To think the first time


HQ is seriously compromised,


it's at the hands of people
and not Angels.


Hard to believe.


GENDOH:
Man's greatest enemy
is his fellow man.


(footsteps echoing)


SHINDO:
Normally this only
takes two minutes.


Are you sure
this is the corridor?


ASUKA:
I'm sure we'll arrive


at the Geo-Front any minute now.


SHINJI:
I've heard that
four times already.


You are such a bore!
You do realize that!


Always hung up on trivial stuff.


-Be quiet.
-What was that, Miss Perfect?


-Human voices.
-BOTH: Huh?


(both gasp)


(distant announcement)


MAKOTO:
Angel approaching.


BOTH:
Mr. Hyuga! Hey!


-Over here! Over here! Here!
-Here!


MAKOTO:
An Angel's approaching.


I repeat, an Angel
is approaching as we speak.


BOTH:
An Angel approaching?


We don't have time.
Let's take a shortcut.


Hey, I'm the leader.
Don't boss me around like that.


Now tell me,
where is this shortcut?


- (thumping)
-(sighs)


I never knew a shortcut
could be this uncomfortable.


So what are the Angels, exactly?


(scoffs) Why are you
bringing this up now?


Angels, emissaries of God,


our enemies have been given
those divine names,


but why are we
fighting each other?


ASUKA:
Don't be an idiot.


Those weird, unexplainable
things are attacking us.


We need to protect ourselves
from stuff like that.


Makes perfect sense.


Hmm. Let's go right.


I think we should try
going to the left.


Oh, just shut up!


Well, what do you think, Shinji?


Uh...


I don't really know.


Ugh! I'm the leader,


so why you both just shut up
and follow me already?


SHINJI:
I knew this wasn't right.


We're going up instead of down.


You knew? What's that mean?


For a man, you're a real nag.
(gasps)


Aha! See? There it is.


I knew I got it right.


(yells)


-(rumble)
-(screams)


(gasping)


(gasps)


We've made
direct visual contact,


and because of me, we now know
that we're gonna need to hurry.


(staff yelps)


(tires squeal)


(over loudspeaker):
There's an Angel
incoming right now!


Suggest launching Evas
to intercept it!


We're in trouble.


-Fuyutsuki, handle things here.
-lkari?


I will get preparations for
launching the Evas under way.


You're going to do it...


manually?


We have emergency generators.


FUYUTSUKI:
But wait...


you're still missing the pilots.


(sighs) This again?


This way.


(grunts)


Ah.


You know, I heard that you're
Commander lkari's little pet.


I guess being the favorite


makes you special,
huh, Miss Perfect?


Please don't do this
right now, Asuka.


That's why you're so prim, huh?


(scoffs)


Hey, just 'cause
you get special treatment


doesn't mean you can ignore me!


I was not ignoring you.


And I'm not receiving
any special treatment.


I can tell that's the case.


Heave-ho! Heave-ho!


Heave-ho!


Heave-ho! Heave-ho!


Roger that.


Shutdown signal plug
extraction complete.


Right. Ready the entry plug
for all three units immediately.


But the pilots
are still missing.


Don't worry about that.


Those kids'll make it in time.


SHINJI: This, I can't
open with my hands.


We have no other choice.


We should break open a duct
and go in through there.


-First scares me a little bit.
-(tapping)


She's a real "the ends justify
the means" kind of person.


You know,
the self-righteous type.


Heave-ho! Heave-ho!


Heave-ho!


Heave-ho! Heave-ho!


Heave-ho!


Entry plug
is locked in position.


Now we just wait
for our Children.


>?


Hey, don't you dare
look forward right now.


I'll kill you if you do!


-Huh?
-Idiot! Idiot!


(echoing):
Idiot! I told you not to look!


SHINJI:
What can I do?!


I have to look forward to move!


(both yell)


(groaning)


There you are.


Now ready all the entry plugs.


MAN:
Roger. Opening hatches manually.


How are the Evas?


They're standing by,


-ready to go.
-MAN: It's secure.


But there isn't any power.


They did it by hand.


It was the commander's idea.


Father's?


(grunting)


RITSUKO:
Commander lkari had faith


that you'd make it in time,
and so he prepared for it.


MAN:
Flywheel's ready
to be connected.


WOMAN:
Eva Unit's interior arrays
are ready to go.


MAN 2:
Get the starters going, now!


(engine revs)


MAYA:
Entry plugs inserted.


RITSUKO:
All units have
completed activation.


Release lockdown bolt
number one.


MAN:
Hydraulic locks number 2
through 32 have been released.


Pressure is zero.
The Evas are clear.


All units, break free
from the restraint locks


using your own power.


Evas, launch!


>?


(Angel warbles)


The target appears
to be directly overhead!


Get it ready right away!


(whirs)


Emergency battery
has been attached!


Right. This'll work.
Launch Evas!


(Asuka grunts)
Oh, man.


This looks so bad.


We are about to reach the shaft.


-(pounding)
-(Asuka grunting)


Oh, could this get
any more embarrassing? (gasps)


(sizzling)


-Danger. Evade now.
-Huh?


(warbling)


(gasps) Oh, no!


(velps)


(Asuka screams)


(warbling)


(sizzling)


(gears whirring)


(Angel warbling)


The target's goal
must be to gain entry to the HQ


by using a powerful acid.


-What do we do?
-"What do we do?"


We defeat it, that's what!


Yeah, sure, but how, exactly?


We've dropped our rifles,


and our battery backpacks
have already run out.


We've got
less than three minutes


until we're immobile.


Listen, I figured it out.


The Unit that stays behind
plays defense.


Defense neutralizes
the A.T. Field


and protects the offense
from the acid.


Support goes down below,
collects the rifle,


and hands it to the offense.


Then the offense
fires the rifle,


destroying the target.


So, you got all that?


Copy that.
I volunteer for defense.


ASUKA:
Sorry, but no.


I will be defense.


But that's dangerous.


That's exactly right.


I need to even out a score
from the time you helped me out,


so, Shinji, you're offense.


And Miss Perfect,


you're on support duty. Got it?


Yes. Understood.


(grunts)


Right. Let's go.


(speaking German)


(grunting)


Ayanami!


Asuka, duck right now!


And so now, we are even.


-MISATO: (gasps) Come on!
- (banging)


Why isn't this opening up?


This is an emergency! (sobs)


-I gotta go...
- (banging)


...right now.


Hey! Hey, you!


I told you not to look up!


(sighs) Right. Sure.


-Huh?
-(rumble)


-(both gasp)
-MISATO: Be careful! (grunts)


(bell dings)


Eh?


(Misato groans)


Indecent.


>?


SHINJI:
It's ironic how the stars
are so much more beautiful


when the power is out
and there's no man-made light.


ASUKA:
Yeah, but without power,


everything looks deserted.


There. That's more reassuring.


Man fears the darkness,


and so he scrapes away
at its edges with fire.


So philosophical.


I wonder if that's
what makes humanity special.


Maybe that's why
the Angels are attacking.


ASUKA:
You're an idiot.


How could we even know
something like that?


TO BE CONTINUED

EPISODE 12: A MIRACLES WORTH
TOHJI:Thanks for letting us stay outof the rain here, Shinji.
KENSUKE:Where's Ms. Misato?
SHINJI:She's probably asleep.
She's been staying up latefor work these days.
TOHJI:Well, she does have a lotof important responsibilities.
In that case,let's try and keep it down.
Ms. Misato could probablyuse the sleep.
KENSUKE and TOHJI:Shh!
ASUKA:Hey!
What are your two dumb friendsdoing here?
Staying out of the rain.
Yeah, right. You're only herebecause you're after me.
I'm in here getting dressed.
If you peek, you're dead.
Yeah, ah!Yeah, well, up yours, witch!
As if anyone on this planetwould want to see you naked.
She's so full of herself.
ALL:Hmm?
(sputtering)
Sorry to wake you, ma'am.
What a pleasant surpriseto see you two.
Welcome home.
Remember, we're doingharmonics testing today,
so don't be late, okay?
SHINJI:Yes, ma'am.
You know that too,right, Asuka?
ASUKA:Yes!
Huh?
Oh! Congratulationson your promotion, Ms. Misato.
TOHJI:Yeah, congratulations,ma'am.
Oh, thank you.
No, ma'am,the honor is all ours.
Okay, guys,I'm heading out now.
BOTH:Have a nice day!
Hey, what's up?
Did something happento Ms. Misato?
The patchon her collar changed.
Now it's got two bars on it.
That means she went frombeing a captain to a major.
That's cool.I didn't know!
When did that happen?
You seriously didn't notice?
Man, you're such a dweeb.
Uh! You're bothtoo self-centered
to pay attention to anyoneoutside of yourselves.
It must be really toughto look after
two junior high schoolstudents at her age.
Well, at least the two of ushave the heart
to appreciateeverything she does.
(whooshing)
- (electronic beep)-MAYA: Number 00 and Number 02are both adjacent
to the contamination zone.This is the limit.
RITSUKO:Seems like Number 01could still go further.
Try lowering the graph depthby 0.3.
(electronic tones pulsing)
MAYA:He's right up tothe contamination zone.
But look at those numbers.
That's very impressive.
He's approaching Asuka in bothharmonics and sync rate values.
I wonder if you couldcall this a talent?
Either way, it looks like thiskid was born to pilot an Eva.
Yes, even thoughhe may not want to.
I'm not sure he has the desireto be a pilot.
(whooshing and clanking)
RITSUKO (over P.A. system):Excellent work, you three.
Shinji, you did well.
SHINJI:I did well?
RITSUKO:Your harmonics values
have increased by eightsince last time.
It's an impressive figure.
Whatever.He's still 50 below me.
Come on, gaining eight in tendays is quite an achievement.
It's not special at all!
Admit it, you love it.
Must feel goodto be lavished with praise.
(Shinji groans)
Whatever.I'm going home, loser.
(radio chatter)
Uh, by the way, congratulationson your promotion.
Thanks,but to tell you the truth,
the promotion doesn't reallymake me happy.
SHINJI:I can understand.
When they werecomplimenting me earlier,
I didn't reallyfeel great, either.
That stuff onlymakes Asuka angry, anyway.
Why does Asuka get angry?
Did I do something wrong?
Does it reallybother you that much?
It does.
She's angry
because you're always worried
about what other people think.
(horn blowing)
ALL:Congratulations, Ms. Misato!
(glasses clinking)
Thanks, everyone.
Thanks for doing this,Suzuhara.
No, no. He's the oneyou should be thanking.
That's right, it was I,Kensuke Aida,
who did all the workputting together this party.
MISATO:Oh, well, then,thank you, Aida.
KENSUKE:You're welcome, but it's nota big deal, really.
I just did what anyone would do.
But I don't recallinviting class rep.
What are you doing here?
I invited her.
Got a problem?
(both laugh)
MISATO:And Rei?
ASUKA:Of course, I invited her,
but, you know,she never hangs out with us.
Hmm. Why isn'tMr. Kaji here yet?
HIKARI:So, is Mr. Kajias cool as you say?
ASUKA:You bet he is!It's like night and day,
compared to these morons.
Honestly, it's an insultto compare him to them.
TOHJI:We can hear you. That's it!
-You and me, outside!-KENSUKE: Are you serious?
MISATO:Still not comfortable
with stuff like this?
Not really. It's just...
I don't do great with crowds.
(overlapping shouting)
Why do we have to getall worked up
and be loud like this?
(shouting continues)
(Pen-Pen squawking)
So, this promotion,
I guess it means you wererecognized by the others
for all your contributionslately, right?
Sure.Guess you could say that.
SHINJI:Well, everyone hereis happy for you,
but how come you're not?
MISATO:It's not likeI'm not glad it happened.
It gives me some satisfaction,
but I didn't come herejust to get promotions.
SHINJI:Then why are you here?
Why do you want to workfor NERV?
I don't know.It's been so long,
I can't really remember.
(shouting continues)
(intercom rings)
(gasps)That must be Mr. Kaji!
-(door opens)-Hmm?
I came straight from HQ.
That's where I happenedto find this one.
BOTH:Likely story.
Do I detect jealousy?
MISATO:(scoffs) Jealous about what?
I want to offer
my sincerest congratulations,
Major Katsuragi.
Seems I can't talk to you
on equal terms anymore.
MISATO:Give me a break, idiot.
You know,it's unprecedented
that both the commanderand deputy commander
are out of Japanat the same time.
I guess it showshow much they trust you
to be in chargewhile they're gone, huh?
Wait. So, Fatherisn't here right now?
Commander lkari is away.He's working in the South Pole.
FUYUTSUKI:A place where lifeis not permitted to exist,
the South Pole is trulythe realm of the dead,
or perhaps calling it hellwould be more apt.
And we, as part of humanity,tread right through it.
Here we are,alive and standing.
FUYUTSUKI:Yes, but we are protectedby the power of science.
GENDOH:Science is man's power.
That kind of arrogance isthe root of this very tragedy.
The Second Impactwas only 15 years ago,
and this is the result.
It was far too severea punishment.
If this isn't a seaof the dead, then what is?
GENDOH:At least it's a pristine world,
untainted by original sin.
FUYUTSUKI:I prefer a worldinhabited by man,
even if they are sinful.
(buzzer)
OPERATOR (over P.A. system):Sorry, sir.
Incoming dispatch from NERV HQ.
Angel detectedin satellite orbit
above the Indian Ocean.
It appeared out of nowheretwo minutes ago.
WOMAN (over P.A. system):Number six observation satellite
en route to intercept.
MAN:Contact in two minutes.
SHIGERU:We have visual of the target.
(all gasp)
That thing is huge!
anymore.
We are about to interceptthe target.
(droning)
WOMAN:Commencing survey.
MAN:Relaying data.
WOMAN:Reception confirmed.
WOMAN 2:Commencing analysis.
(static)
That was an A.T. Field.
That's an inventive wayof using it.
(shutter clicks)
MISATO:The destructive powerIS enormous,
an A.T. Fieldas impressive as ever.
MAYA:It's also utilizing the energyfrom its descent.
The Angel itself is like a bombready to drop.
The first shotappears to be a miss
that fell into the Pacific,and the second shot,
two hours later.
It's correcting its trajectoryas it goes.
That means it's learningby trial and error.
MAKOTO:The aerial N2 minesare having no effect.
SHIGERU:And since then, we're lostcontact with the Angel.
I'll wagerit's heading this way.
The next strike will be here,dropping itself on us.
MISATO:I wonder if it'll create
a third Lake Ashiin the process.
RITSUKO:The five lakes of Fujiwill all connect
with the Pacific Ocean,including HQ.
MISATO:And the commander?
SHIGERU:Powerful ECM jamming
is preventing usfrom contacting him.
What does the Magi say?
All three are suggestingwe evacuate immediately.
So, what do we do? You'rethe one in charge right now.
Contact the Japanese governmentand its agencies.
Issue Special Declaration D-17under NERV authority.
Citizens withina 50-kilometer radius
should be evacuated immediately.
Have Matsushiro createa backup of the Magi.
Ma'am, are weabandoning headquarters?
No, but there's no reasonto needlessly
put the population at risk.
ANNOUNCER (over loudspeaker):The government has issued
Special Declaration D-17.
All citizens are requiredto immediately evacuate
ALL LANES OUTBOUND
to their designated locations.
ANNOUNCER 2:Blocks six and sevenhave priority.
Please move quicklyand follow the instructions
given by your ward peers.
ANNOUNCER:Citizens within the city limits
have been evacuated.
ANNOUNCER 3:All noncombatants
and Class-D employees specifiedin Departmental Alert C
have been evacuated.
(water running)
RITSUKO:You can't be serious.
MISATO:I'm dead serious.
It's an arbitrary decisionthat will lead
to the destructionof three Evas.
The odds of successare 0.00001.
That basically means it's zero.
But it's not zero.
I'm just bettingon the Evas.
Major Katsuragi!
I'm the senior officerin charge here.
I want to do everythingI possibly can.
Defeating the Angelsis my job.
RITSUKO:Your job? Don't be ridiculous.
This is purely about you.
You want revenge on the Angels.
ASUKA:What? You want us to catch itwith our hands?
MISATO:Correct.The Evas will be positioned
at the estimatedpoint of impact.
You will directlycatch the Angel
using the full powerof your Eva's A.T. Fields.
But what if the Angelveers off of its course?
Well, then we'd be screwed.
And what do we do if the Evas
can't withstand the impact?
That would screw us as well.
What are our chances?
I have no idea.
Only God could know that.
I guess it would be arealmiracle if this plan worked.
A miracle's worthis In making them happen,
and we've got to try,no matter what.
So, you want us to justmake it work, is that right?
There is no other way.
This operation is all we have.I'm very sorry.
This isn't an operation!It's a joke!
MISATO:I guess it is, isn't it?
You're welcome to refuse,if that's what you want.
So, you're in?
According to regulations,
you are instructedto prepare your wills.
Would you like to?
No, I don't need to.
I have no intention to die.
I'm fine, as well.
I have no need for one.
I don't need to, either.
MISATO:Thank you, really.
We'll go outfor some nice steaks
when this is all done, okay?
ASUKA:Steak? Really?
MISATO:Yeah, my treat.
SHINJI:What a great deal.
ASUKA:Okay, but don't forget.
MISATO:(laughs) Trust me, I won't.
A steak dinner rewardis pretty typical of her.
She should know betterthan to think kids these days
would care aboutgetting a steak dinner.
The Second Impact generation
just can't shaketheir impoverished upbringing.
Take it easy.She can't help it.
Ha! "What a great deal," huh?
You laid it on pretty thick.
Think she got the message?
If it putsMs. Misato's mind at ease
while running this operation,what's the problem?
All right, then.Since she promised to take us
All right, then.Since she promised to take us
to a gourmet restaurant,I'm gonna pick a place
to a gourmet restaurant,I'm gonna pick a place
that is expensive,and this time around,
you're going to come with us.
I won't be joining you.
Why not?
I don't like eating meat.
MAYA:Interference from the Angel
Is jamming our radarsfrom tracking it.
MISATO:We don't have a precise readon its position,
but based on telemetry gatheredprior to losing contact,
the point of impactestimated by the Magi is this.
ASUKA:The area is that wide?
From edge to edge,that's a pretty wide area.
Just by employingits powerful A.T. Field,
it would tear apart HQby making impact
in any locationwithin this area.
MISATO:Which is why I haveassigned the Evas
to these three locations.
How did you inferour positioning?
MISATO:Intuition.
ASUKA and SHINJI:Intuition?
Yes, woman's intuition.
Talk about wild guesses.
It's getting harderand harder
to imagine this miracleis gonna happen.
She's not especially lucky,either.
She's never won a scratch card.
(groans)
SHINJI:Hey...
ASUKA:What?
SHINJI:Why do you pilot an Eva?
ASUKA:(sighs) So the world can witnessmy extraordinary talents.
Why else, dummy?
SHINJI:You do it to be seen?
Well, I guessit's something like that.
How come you're not askingthe First?
SHINJI:I asked Ayanamithat question already.
Hmm. I guess you twoare lovey-dovey.
No, it's not like that.
So, why do you pilot it?
I don't know.
What do you mean,you don't know?
Are you a complete idiot?
Maybe I am.
(sighs)
ASUKA:You really are an idiot.
MAYA (over P.A. system):120 minutes to estimatedtime of impact.
I can handle this myself.
You should evacuatewhile there's still time.
Sorry, but we stillhave work to do.
Yeah. No way we're gonnalet the Children
face the danger all alone.
Oh, you don't have to worryabout them.
Even if the Evas are destroyed,
the A.T. Fieldswill protect them.
Being inside an Evais the safest place to be.
MISATO:Shinji, yesterdayyou asked me why I joined NERV,
and I wasn't honest with you.
My father was a researcher,consumed by his work,
so engrossedhe lived in his dreams,
and I couldn't forgive himfor being that way.
I hated him.
SHINJI:Just like my father.
MISATO:He couldn't be botheredto be with his family,
his wife, his own daughter.
People who knew him sayhe was a sensitive man,
but the truth was,he was a weak-hearted man
that couldn't stomach reality,
a man that hadto shield himself away
from the realityof his own family,
a man that waspractically a child.
When my motherfinally divorced him,
I was so happy for her.
He made her cry so much.
It took my father by surprise,
but he deservedevery moment of it.
In the end,he saved my life
by sacrificing his.
It happened duringthe Second Impact.
I didn't knowwhat to feel anymore.
I wasn't sure if I hated himor loved him,
but there was one thingI did know.
I had to destroy the Angelsthat caused the Second Impact.
That's why I joined NERV.
I guess maybe in the end
it all boils down to me wantingrevenge against my father
so I can be rid of the cursehe has over me.
SHINJI: Don't run away,don't run away, don't run away!
Okay, don't run away.
SHIGERU:Optical magnificationhas confirmed the target!
MAKOTO:Distance is approximately25,000.
Okay, there's no turning back.
All Evas to start positions now.
(whooshing)
>?
MISATO:Our trajectory calculations
are entirely dependenton optical observation,
so the Magi will guide you
until the targetgets to 10,000.
From there,use your best judgment.
We're putting our trustin you.
MAXIMUM TELEPHOTOSHIGERU:Angel incoming.
Distance approximately 20,000.
All right, commence operation.
Let's go.
>?
(whooshing and beeping)
Mission start!
(thudding)
SHIGERU:Distance, 12,000.
>?
A.T. Field!
(groans)
Unit 02, raise to full power.
I am raising it!
>?
Do it!
Damn you!
(thunderous booming)
-(indistinct P.A. announcement)-(Asuka giggles)
SHIGERU:Radio systems back online.
Incoming transmissionfrom Commander Ikari.
MISATO:Patch him through.
SHIGERU:Yes, ma'am.
I should apologize, sir.
My reckless decision-making
caused Eva Unit 01to suffer excessive damage.
I take full responsibilityfor it, sir.
FUYUTSUKI:No matter.
That was a small price to pay
for defeating the target.
We shouldconsider ourselves lucky
to have gotten awaywith minimal damage.
GENDOH:Agreed.
You performed well,Major Katsuragi.
Thank you very much, sir.
GENDOH:Is the Unit 01 pilot present?
Uh, yes, sir.
GENDOH:I heard the news.
Good work, Shinji.
Um, thank you, sir.
GENDOH:Right. Major Katsuragi,
I'll leave youto handle the rest.
MISATO:Sir.
ALL LANES INBOUND
(horns honking)
TOKYO-3 LOOP LINE NO.7
WOMAN (over P.A. system):Next stop is New Miyanoshita.
New Miyanoshita.
Doors will open on the left.
ASUKA:Time for you to keepyour end of the bargain.
I know, I know. I pulled outa huge wad of cash
just to treat you guysto a nice dinner.
Although paydayisn't until tomorrow.
>?
>?
ASUKA:I know you're hurtingfinancially, Misato,
so don't worry about it, okay?
Besides, Miss Perfectsaid she'd come
if we went out for ramen.
REI:I want garlic ramenwithout pork.
ASUKA:Shark-fin ramen withroasted pork, and make it large.
STALL OWNER:You got it.Shark-fin ramen with pork.
SHINJI:Uh, Ms. Misato?
MISATO:What is it?
SHINJI:Listening to my father
praise me just now,
hearing those words,
it was the first timeI realized
it makes me happywhen he praises me.
That helped me figure out
that maybe the reasonI pilot the Eva
is because I wantto hear my father
say stuff like that to me.
Wait. That's the reasonyou pilot an Eva?
You really are a dummy.

(background P.A. announcements)
Very fast, Maya.That's amazing.
Well, this is a giftI only possess
thanks to you, Doctor.
Oh, stop a sec.
An A-8 would bea lot faster there.
Here, let me show you.
Doctor, that's amazing.
Hey, there. Are you donewith diagnostics on the Magi?
Yeah, pretty much.I kept my promise
of having it readybefore today's test.
Amazing as always, Ritsuko.I don't know how you do it,
keeping trackof all three of them.
That's probably cold by now.
(spits)
(beeping)
(beeping)
MALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):All three units
of the Magi system
have entered intoself-diagnostic mode.
MAYA (over P.A.):127th routine check-up results,
no abnormalities.
RITSUKO (over P.A.):Roger.
Good work, everyone.
Take a breakuntil the testing starts.
No abnormalities.
My mother's doing fine,
while I'm growing olderwith each passing day.
EPISODE 13: ANGEL INFILTRATION
ASUKA:What? We have to undress again?
RITSUKO (over P.A.):You're about to enterinto an ultra-sterile room.
Just having a shower
and changing underwearwon't be enough.
ASUKA:Why do we have to go throughall this trouble
just to testsome autopilot systems?
RITSUKO (over P.A.):Time doesn't wait for anyone.
The Eva's technologyis always improving.
We constantly neednew data to work from.
(Asuka and Shinji groan)
(bell dings)
ASUKA:There! We're exactlyhow you want us,
squeaky clean after 17 showers.
RITSUKO (over P.A.):Next, we need you to gothrough this room
and get into the entry plugsdressed just as you are now.
What?!
RITSUKO (over P.A.):Don't worry,
the visual feed is off-line.
We respect your privacy.
That's not the point,and you know it!
You're embarrassing us.
RITSUKO (over P.A.):The aim of this test
is to gauge how the harmonics
will be picked upfrom your bodies
without the aidof the plug suits.
It's a direct order, Asuka.
ASUKA:Ugh! Don't you darelook at me, got it?
MALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):All pilots are ready
for the entry sequence.
We can start the test.
MALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):Starting the test.
Initiate autopilot recording.
FEMALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):No abnormalities detected.
MALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):Inserting simulation plug.
(clanking and whirring)
FEMALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):Connecting the system
to the imitation Eva bodies.
(electronic beeping)
FEMALE OPERATOR:Simulation entry plugs
are now controlled by the Magi.
MISATO:Wow, that was fast.
The Magi sure makesa big difference.
This is a far cryfrom the first test,
which took an entire week.
MALE OPERATOR:The test is scheduled
to end in roughly three hours.
RITSUKO (over P.A.):How are you feeling?
Something is different.
Yeah, it does feeldifferent somehow.
Our sense of touch seems weird.
I can sense my right armreally well,
but the rest is pretty hazy.
RITSUKO (over P.A.):Rei, mentally picture
moving your right arm.
Roger.
(clanking)
(rumbling)
MALE OPERATOR:Data collection is proceedingsmoothly.
Everything looks good.
Revert the Magi'soperating mode.
Inner conflict.
You can really sensethe personality
of the person who built this.
MISATO:What are you talking about?
You built this, didn't you?
You don't know muchabout the Magi, do you?
Well, that's becauseyou don't like to talk about
what you're working onor even yourself, unlike me.
RITSUKO:I guess that's true.
I was the one who gotthe system up and running.
The core theory and mainframes
were built by my mother.
were built by my mother.
FUYUTSUKI:Are others aware of this?
SHIGERU:Yes, sir.
It's on parts that wereinstalled three days ago.
This is the partthat deteriorated.
FUYUTSUKI:Protein wall number 87, is it?
When I magnify the image,it reveals something
that looks like stains,but I don't know what it is.
It's probably corrosion.
Temperature and conductivity
are fluctuating somewhatin that area.
Degradation of the clean room
seems to be happeningmore often these days.
Well, the construction windowgot compressed by 60 days,
so air bubbles probably gotmixed in as a result.
Also, the Wing B constructionis poor, too.
That wing was builtafter the Angels reappeared.
You really can't blame them.
Everyone is getting fatigued.
Have this addressed by tomorrow
or lkari will raise a stink.
MAKOTO:Roger.
(rumbling)
Another water leak?
Yes. They say there's corrosion
in the protein walls above us.
RITSUKO:How annoying.
Will it impede the tests?
Not at this time.No, it won't.
Then we'll continue.
This test shouldn't bestopped halfway
without us havinga very good reason.
Commander Ikariwould raise a stink.
MAYA:Roger. Synchronizationposition nominal.
MALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):No change in plug depth.
MALE OPERATOR 2 (over P.A.):Connecting simulation plug
to the Eva main bodyvia the imitation body.
MALE OPERATOR 3:Connection to Eva Unit 00confirmed.
FEMALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):A.T. Field strength
of two yoctos will be projected.
(whirring)
-(alarm blaring)-What is it?
COMPUTERIZED VOICE:Contamination alarmon Floor A of the Sigma Unit.
MALE OPERATOR:Protein wall 87 has degradedand is emitting heat.
MALE OPERATOR 2:Abnormalities detectedat Tube Number 6.
The corrosion is spreadinglike wildfire
along the protein walls.
It's moving really fast!
Abort the test! Emergencyshutdown, Tube Number 6.
MAYA:Roger.
(whirring)
(clanking)
60, 38 and 39have all been shut off.
Corrosion at Number 6 is 42.
It's not working.
The corrosion is spreadingalong the wall lining.
Prepare the polysomes.
>?
RITSUKO:Set lasers to maximum strength.
Fire as soonas intrusion occurs.
(hissing and electronic beeping)
MAYA: Corrosion has reachedNumber 6's Tube 58.
Incoming!
REI:No!
Rei, no!
>?
Rei's imitation body is moving!
That can't be.
>?
MAYA:The corrosionis spreading even further.
It's contaminating the imitationbody's pituitary system.
>?
(banging and thudding)
Rei's status?
Unharmed.
Emergency ejection of all plugs.
Ready the lasers right now.
(whooshing)
>?
(clanging)
It's an A.T. Field!
It can't be!
(whooshing)
What is this?
The pattern analysis is blue.
That's definitely an Angel.
(alarm blaring)
An Angel? How was an Angelallowed to invade?
RITSUKO (over phone):I'm very sorry, sir.
I don't need excuses.
Physically closethe Central Dogma
and quarantine itfrom the Sigma Unit.
MALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):Physical closure
of Central Dogma initiated.
We have ordersto abandon the box!
Everyone evacuate!
(panicked chatter)
(crackling)
What are you doing?Hurry!
>?
FEMALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):Sigma Unit is being isolatedfrom Floor B.
All bulkheads will be closed.
All personnel within specifiedareas must evacuate.
I am aware.I leave it to you.
(alarm blaring)
Shut off the alarm.
SHIGERU:Uh, shutting off the alarm.
(alarm stops)
Faulty detectorscaused the alarm.
Report as such to the counciland the government.
SHIGERU:Yes, sir.
MAKOTO:The contaminated area
is descending downward.
It's spreadingfrom the Pribnow box
to the entire Sigma Unit.
That's dangerous.
GENDOH:Yes. Too close to Adam.
Contain the spreadwithin the Sigma Unit.
If need be,sacrifice the Geo-Front.
How are the Evas?
They're standing by at Cage 7.
They can be launched immediately
following pilot retrieval.
GENDOH:Do not wait for the pilots.
Launch them to the surfaceimmediately.
(Makoto and Shigeru gasp)
Unit 01 is priority one.
The other two can be abandonedif it becomes necessary.
Unit 01 gets priority?
But it's impossible for us
to physically defeat the Angelswithout an Eva.
If the Evas get contaminated,
everything we've donewill go up in smoke. Hurry.
MAKOTO/SHIGERU:Yes, sir.
(electricity zapping)
FEMALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):All areas of the Central Dogma
below the Sigma Unit
will be completely locked downin 60 seconds.
So that's the Angel.
I guess my workwill have to wait.
(bangs)
FEMALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):The Central Dogma
has been completely locked down.
The underground facility
has been occupiedby the intruder.
Right. How do we deal withthis Angel without the Evas?
(whooshing)
RITSUKO:See? That's the borderof the heavy water.
There's lots of oxygen here.
MAYA:It seems picky aboutwhere it wants to go.
SHIGERU:Ozone is vented in to maintainaseptic conditions,
and it looks like that partisn't contaminated yet.
So, then, oxygenis its weakness?
I believe it is.
(whooshing)
Venting in ozone.
Increasing the concentration.
Looks like it's working.
Will it succeed?
(whooshing)
MAYA:Zero-A and Zero-Bappear to be recovering.
SHIGERU:Areas around the tubeare returning to normal.
MAKOTO:The central area seemsto be holding up quite well.
FUYUTSUKI:Good. Increase the ozone.
(typing on keyboard)
That's so strange.
Wait. What?
It's spreading again.
This is weird.
The heat has started increasing.
SHIGERU:The contaminated areas
are increasing again.
Decontamination has stopped.
It's not working anymore.
It's begun to absorb
all of the ozone now.
Stop the ozone!
Astonishing.
It's evolvingright before our eyes.
(alarm blaring)
What's going on?
SHIGERU:The sub-computeris being hacked.
Intruder identity unknown.
Not right now, damn it.Employ Mode-C!
Lowering firewall and stagingdecoy interface right now.
Tracing.Ready in 18 seconds.
MALE OPERATOR:Firewall is up.
MALE OPERATOR 2:Firewall has been breached!
SHIGERU:Staging another decoy interface.
MAKOTO:No human could possibly do this.
SHIGERU:Tracing is complete.
It's inside this facility!
Point of origin is...
the B-Wing Pribnow box!
>?
MAYA:Its optical patternis changing.
Those glowing linesare electronic circuits.
That thing is actuallya computer!
Staging decoy interface.
Failure.Attempt has been interfered.
Sever the main cable right now.
MALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):Negative. It won't respond.
Then fire the lasers at it.
MAYA:It has an AT. Field.Lasers won't work.
It's trying to accessthe memory banks
of the Security Department.
It's running passwords.
12 digits, 16 digits.
It has the decode string!
No way! It's hackedinto the main banks
at the Security Department!
-(groans)-It's accessing everything!
We can't stop it!
What is the Angel's goal here?
SHIGERU:It's searchingthrough the main path.
This code is... No!
It's trying to crackinto the Magi!
(alarm blaring)
>?
GENDOH:Shut down the 1/0 system.
>?
Start the countdown!
Three, two, one...
(clicking)
(Makoto and Shigeru groan)
We can't cut the power!
MAYA:The Angel is still breaching!
It has now gained accessto Melchior.
It won't stop!The Angel is taking over!
(beeps)
The Angel has completelyreprogrammed Melchior!
FEMALE COMPUTER VOICE:Artificial intelligenceMelchior
has proposed an autonomousself-destruction.
Denied, denied, denied.
Ugh! Melchior is now tryingto hack into Balthazar.
(alarm blaring)
Damn, it's fast.
>?
Calculation is crazy fast.
>?
(alarm blaring)
Change the logic mode!
Sync code breakto 15-second intervals.
MAKOTO/SHIGERU:Roger!
(electronic beeps fading)
(sighs)
How much time did that buy us?
SHIGERU:Judging from its speed,I'd say about two hours.
GENDOH:To think the Magicould betray us...
(beeping continues)
RITSUKO:This Angel is a groupof nanomachines
no larger than microbes.
These machines gathered togetherto form a colony
and rapidly evolved to the point
where they formed Al circuitryin a very short time.
FUYUTSUKI:It's evolving?
RITSUKO:Yes, sir.
They exist in a constant stateof transformation
and are always searchingfor various means
to counterany possible situation.
So, then, it's utilizing
the same system of survivalthat life-forms use.
The best way to defeata target like this,
one that's constantly evolvingand overcoming its weaknesses,
is to sacrifice oneself with it,
so in this case, the Angelhas to die with the Magi.
Therefore, my proposal is thatwe destroy the Magi system.
Impossible. Destroying the Magiis tantamount to abandoning HQ.
As head ofthe operations department,
I officially request it!
I reject it!
This problem is forthe tech department to solve.
Why are you being so stubborn?
All this happened becauseof a mistake that I made.
You've always been like this,
tackling everything by yourself.
You never ask for help.
If the Angelis constantly evolving,
then we can defeat it.
By pushing its evolution?
RITSUKO:Yes.
The final destinationis self-destruction.
It is death itself.
So, then the solution
would be to accelerate
the evolution of the Angel?
RITSUKO: If the Angel wantsto avoid its own death,
then it may choose to coexistwith the Magi instead.
But how can we force that?
If its goal is the computer,
then we'll connect the Angeldirectly to Casper.
Then, Casperwill reverse-hack itself
and install a self-destructionencouragement program, but...
To do that, it means Casper

It'll come downto who can be faster,
-Casper or the Angel.-Yes.
Can you be certain thatyou'll be ready in time?
If Casper gets knocked outby the Angel,
that's the end for us.
I keep my promises.

Wait. What are allthese notes, huh?
Scribbles from the developer.
So cool.These are backdoor codes.
They're backdoor codesto the Magi!
MISATO: So, this is a hugecollection of Magi hacks?
MAYA: I feel anxious justlooking at all of this.
(gasps)I can't believe it!
This is the CS integer!
This will allow us to writethe program really quickly,
isn't that right, Doctor?
Mm.
RITSUKO:Thank you, Mother.
Now we'll succeed.

RITSUKO:Wrench, please.
(clicking)
This reminds me ofour college days together.
RITSUKO:Keyboard 25, please.
(typing on keyboard)
Hey, so can you tell me
a little bit moreabout the Magi?
RITSUKO:It's a long story,
and a pretty boring one,all things considered.
Ever heard of personalitytransplant type 0S?
MISATO:Um, a system wherean individual's personality
is transplantedinto an organic computer
so it can havecognitive thought, right?
It's the exact same technologywe use for piloting the Evas.
RITSUKO:The Magi was the firstprototype for that.
It's technologythat my mother developed.
So, wait. Was ityour mother's personality
that was transplanted?
Correct.
(saw buzzing)
(buzzing stops)
You could even say that this ismy mother's brain right here.
Is that why you wantedto protect the Magi?
I don't think so.
I'm afraid my mother and I werenever exactly very close.
I did this as a scientist.
-MAKOTO: It's here.-(alarm blaring)

I wonder what's going on.
Aah!We can't go anywhere

Somebody come help us, please!
FEMALE OPERATOR (over P.A.):Sigma Unit is now opened.
The Magi system will restartin minus 03 seconds.
(footfalls approaching)
I think I'm getting too old.
I can't handlethese all-nighters.
Once again, you managedto keep your promise.
Excellent work.
Thanks.
After all these years,
I never would have thoughta cup of coffee
prepared by youwould taste so good.
(groans)
RITSUKO:The night before she died,
my mother told methe Magi are comprised
of the three peopleinside her...
herself as a scientist,
herself as a mother,
and herself as a woman.
Those three sideswere constantly vying
for control of her.
She incorporatedinner conflict into the Magi,
and she programmed all threeto be different from each other.
I could never becomea mother myself,
so I can't really speakabout who she was
in regards to that side,and as a scientist,
I always had completeand utter respect for her,
but as a woman, there wasa part of me that hated her.
MISATO:You're talkative today.
It's been known to happen.
(whirring)
Casper was programmed
with the partof my mother's personality
that was a woman,
and the woman inside of herheld out to the bitter end.
That's just like her.

COUNCIL MEMBER 2:Indeed.
COUNCIL MEMBER 2:Indeed.
There were no contingency plans
for an Angel intrusioninto NERV HQ.
And to think the Angeleven gained access
to the Central Dogma.
If contact had been made,
then all of our plans would havebeen completely compromised.
I believe the Councilwas informed
that it was a false alarm.
There was noAngel security breach.
I see. So you claimthere was no breach
by the Eleventh Angel,is that correct?
Yes.
I'd watch myselfif I were you, Ikari.
Making false statements hereis a capital offense.
You're always welcome to review
the Magi's data recorders,if you like.
You will find no recordof any such incident.
Don't make us laugh.
We knowyou're exceptionally capable
of falsifying the facts.
I'll schedule this proceeding
just as the Dead Sea Scrollsdescribed.
Fine.Our deliberation
over your negligencein this matter is over.
However, there is no needfor you to create
your own scenario here.
GENDOH:I'm well aware.
Everything will proceedaccording to Seele scenario.
EPISODE 14: SEELE, THE SEAT OF THE SOUL
REI:Mountains, heavy mountains,
something that changesover time.
The sky, the blue sky,
something we can't see...
and something we can.
The sun.There is only one.
Water,something that feels nice.
Commander Ikari.Flowers.
There are manythat are the same,
many that I don't want.
The sky.
Red, a red sky.
Red color.I don't like the color red.
Flowing water.Blood.
The smell of blood.
A woman who does not bleed.
Human beings made from red clay.
Human beings madefrom a man and a woman.
The city.The work of man.
Eva, the work of man.
What is man?
Was it God that created him
or did man create man?
Inside me,I have life and heart.
The vessel of the heart.
Entry plug.
Seat of the soul.
Who is this?
This is me.
Who am I?
What am I?
What am I? What am I?
What am I?
I am myself.
This object is myself.
The shape that forms myself.
The me that can be seen.
But I feel likeI am not who I am.
It's strange.
I feel my body is melting away.
I no longer recognize myself.
I'm losing my shape.
I feel the presenceof someone else.
Is there someone there,beyond here?
Shinji.
I know this person.Major Katsuragi.
Dr. Akagi.
These are my classmates.
Pilot of Unit 02.
Commander Ikari.
Who are you? Who are you?
Who are you?
RITSUKO (over P.A. system):So, Rei,
how was your first timebeing in Unit 01?
It smells like Shinji.
PILOT INTEROPERABILITY TEST NO. 1SUBJECT: REI AYANAMI
Her synchronization ratesare no different from Unit 00.
Well, Unit 00and Unit 01's personal patterns
are very similar.
RITSUKO:That's why it's possible
for them to synchronize.
MAYA:Margin of erroris plus or minus 0.03.
Harmonics are nominal.
No issues in the compatibility
of Rei with Unit 01have been detected.
RITSUKO:Right. End the test.
Rei, you can come up now.
Yes.
(whooshing)
87TH EVA UNIT COORDINATION TESTSUBJECT: ASUKA LANGLEY SORYU
MAN:Unit 02's data banksare complete.
WOMAN:Harmonic values are all nominal.
MAN 2:No issues with the pilot.
Or course there aren't.
PILOT INTEROPERABILITY TEST NO. 1SUBJECT: SHINJI IKARI
WOMAN:Entry plug insertion complete.
RITSUKO:Status of Unit 00'spersonal data?
MAYA:Data has already beenrewritten.
Currently verifying.
How is the subject?
ANALYST:Subject seems slightly tense,
but no issues withhis nerve signal patterns.
MISATO:This is the first timehe's piloting Unit 00
or any other Eva,for that matter.
It's only natural.
What an idiot.
He shouldn't getso worked up all the time
and just take it easy.
That's just notwho Shinji is.
He can't do that.
Yeah, I know.
That's why he's an idiot.
(Misato laughs weakly)
So, do I have to participatein the test they just did,
exchanging Eva Units like that?
You don't want to pilot an Evaother than Unit 02, right?
Yeah, I guess that's true.
MISATO:The truth is, Unit 02
simply isn't compatiblewith the other Evas.
MAYA:Entry sequence has started.
WOMAN:LCL ionized.
MAYA:Starting level-one connection.
RITSUKO:Shinji, how is it insideUnit 00's entry plug?
SHINJI:It feels a little strange.
MAYA:Are you feeling any discomfort?
SHINJI:No. It's just...
it smells like Ayanami.
What do you mean by "smell"?Geez, what a perv.
MAYA:Data received. Re-verifying.Pattern green.
WOMAN:Main power connection complete.
MAN:All restraining gear is green.
WOMAN:Roger.
RITSUKO:Proceed to Stage Two
of the interchangeability test.
MAYA:Unit 00 initiatinglevel-two contact.
-How does it look?-RITSUKO: As expected,
his sync rates aren't as high,compared to Unit 01.
MAYA:The harmonics are all nominal.
RITSUKO:These numbers are pretty good.
It looks like our plan of actionmight be ready to go.
Do you mean the Dummy system?
With all due respect, ma'am,I find that plan very...
Objectionable?I can understand that,
but having contingency plansare important
in order for people to survive.
I have nothing but respectfor you, ma'am,
and I will do my job,but I'm not sure this is right.
Being too principledcan be painful.
I'll make it harderto work with others.
If you're causedto take actions against them,
it'll feel disgusting.
(background P.A. announcements)
(whooshing)
WOMAN:Initiating level-threeconnection.
MAN:Mental assessment is stable.
Oh, Shinji-winji,want to call your mom?
Maybe you can crawlback inside the womb!
RITSUKO:Asuka,
you're messing uphis concentration.
Yeah, yeah!
Geez, why is everyonearound here
always coddling Shinjiso much?
RITSUKO:Initiating A-10nerve connection.
WOMAN:Harmonics level plus 20.
(reverberation)
SHINJI:What is this?
Something's coming directlyinto my head.
Oh, it's Ayanami.
Is this you?
This feeling, it feelslike Rei Ayanami.
(birds calling)
Ayanami?
Or maybe not.
-(roaring)-What's going on?
MAN:Pilot's nerve pulseis fluctuating.
Psychological contaminationstarted!
Impossible. The plug depthshould be too shallow for that.
MAYA:It's not the plug.
The Eva is corroding him.
(roaring)
MAYA:We've lost control of Unit 00!
(growling)
Full circuit shutdown.Cut off the power!
(bang, hissing)
(growls)
WOMAN:The Eva has switchedto auxiliary power.
MAN:Unit 00 is still active.
-What's Shinji's status?-MAKOTO: Data feed is down.
Can't get a read.
Did Unit 00 refuse Shinji?
No response. The auto-ejectmechanism is not functioning.
Will it take in Shinji?Is it happening again,
just like before?
(crashing)
-Rel, get back!-WOMAN: Unit 00...
-MISATO: Rei!-WOMAN: ...will completeshutdown
in ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five,
four, three,
two, one, zero.
(powering down)
Unit 00 has completed shutdown.
Priority one,pilot rescue! Hurry!
MISATO:Was Rei the target?
Did Unit 00 want to kill her?
MISATO:Do you think this incidenthad something to do
with the rampage Unit 00did before with Rei onboard?
RITSUKO: I can't be certainof anything just yet.
In order to determine that,
we'd have to revertUnit 00's personal data to Rei
and do another synchronizationtest with her.
MISATO:As Operations Director,
I request that this be doneas soon as possible.
We don't want to impedeour effectiveness.
RITSUKO:Understood, Major Katsuragi.
(footsteps receding)
RITSUKO:Unit 00 was trying to attack me.
I'm absolutely certain of it.
(gasps)
(radio playing faintly)
Not here.I hate this ceiling.
Received word that Shinji hasjust regained consciousness.
I'm told there areno residual effects.
He says he doesn'tremember anything.
I see.
(radio playing faintly)
ASUKA:Neither Misato nor Mr. Kajiwill tell me anything,
and Shinji'scompletely ignorant.
First Children. Who is she?
FUYUTSUKI:So, the HumanInstrumentality Council
found out aboutthe Angel invasion
and decided to bother us?
They're a miserable lot.
Their only job is to complainabout what others are doing.
GENDOH:Not to worry.We hold all the trump cards.
There's nothing they can do.
FUYUTSUKI:That's no excusefor making them anxious.
If Seele got involvedwith us now,
things could get complicated.
GENDOH:Everything is proceedingaccording to our scenario.
There are no problems.
FUYUTSUKI:What about the incidentwith Unit 00?
That wasn't in any scenarioI've read.
GENDOH:It's not important.
The resynchronization of Reito Unit 00 was successful.
FUYUTSUKI: Ikari is fartoo fixated on Rei.
What about Project Adam?
GENDOH:Proceeding smoothly.Everything is on schedule.
FUYUTSUKI:What of the Spear of Longinus?
GENDOH:It's on track.Rei is carrying out the work.

I just hopethere won't be any more.
Chairman Keel lodgeda complaint recently
regarding delaysin the schedule,
and it was directedto me personally.
He seems rather irritated.
At the end, he even implied
you may be relievedof your post.
GENDOH:Adam is proceeding well,and we've started work
on the Dummy Plugwith Project Eva.
What are the geriatricsat Seele complaining about?
The Human InstrumentalityProject
they're always so obsessed with.
GENDOH:Every project is interlinked.
There are no problemsin the schedule.
FUYUTSUKI:What about Rei?
Fine. Never mind, then.
What should be doneabout that man?
GENDOH:Let him go about his business.
The same goesfor the Marduk Institute.

WOMAN:It's me.
KAJI:Oh, there you are.
-(cat meows)-Shannon Bio Tech,
a chemical firmfunded with foreign capital.
It's been here for nine years,
but this place hasn't changedat all in that time.
Of the 108 corporations withties to the Marduk Institute,
106 were dummy setups.
So, that makes this onethe 107th.
WOMAN:Here's the company registry.
KAJI: You want me to noticethe board of directors, right?
WOMAN:You already knew?
KAJI:I recognized most of the names.
The Marduk Institute,an advisory body
that reports directly to theHuman Instrumentality Council,
established to find potentialEvangelion pilots.
The nature of the organizationremains unclear.
WOMAN:Your job is to investigate NERV.
Messing around with Mardukis trouble.
Well, it's who I am.
Until I figure this out,
I'm just not gonnabe able to let it go.
(phone rings)
-(answering machine clicks)-KAJI: You got Kaji.
Currently, I'm either awayor can't talk now.
Leave your name and messageat the beep.
(answering machine beeps)
(screams)Please help me, Mr. Kaji!
Get away from me, pervert!(screams)
- (phone beeps)-That should do it.
Everything okay?
No, everything is not okay.
I was hoping Mr. Kaji wouldtake me someplace tomorrow,
and I've been callingand calling him,
but he never answers.
He's always away,no matter when I try him.
Wait. Does that meanyou're free tomorrow?
I suppose it does, all day.
If that's the case,
-can I ask a big favor?-Huh?
I'm sorry to impose, but...
What?! A date?!
He's friends with Kodama.You know, my older sister.
He really wanted meto introduce you to him.
It doesn't have to bea big deal. Please?
(running footfalls)
TOHJI:Attack!
-Quit getting distracted!-SHINJI: Sorry.
And you're getting distractedfrom the cleaning!
WOMAN (over P.A.):Necrosis operation complete.
MAN (over P.A.):Reversible graphmeasurements complete.
What are you goingto wear tomorrow?
Wear? Oh, you mean the wedding.
Let's see. I wore the pink suitat Kiyomi's wedding,
and I just worethe navy blue dress for Kotoko,
so that means...
And the orange one?
You haven't worn that onein a while.
That's right.
There's just a little problemwith that one.
-Too tight?-Yeah, right.
(groans) I'll have to buysomething on the way home.
Oh, my spending is completelyout of control these days.
With so many weddings lately,
the gift money aloneis starting to add up.
(scoffs) It's just,everybody's so damn anxious
to get hitchedbefore the big 3-0 hits.
Can you really blame them?
No one wants to bethe last one single.
All right, you three,you can come up now.
RITSUKO (over P.A.):Nice work today.
ASUKA:Can't we do somethingother than test?
This is so boring!
So, Shinji-- he seemedparticularly glum today,
even for him.
Well, there's tomorrow.
That's right. Tomorrow.
So, uh, tomorrow I haveto meet with my father.
Do you have any advice for me?
Why would you ask mea question like that?
I saw you and Fathertalking once,
and he looked like he wasenjoying the conversation.
So, my father, what's he like?
I don't know.
Oh.
You wanted to ask me.
That's the reason you werestaring at me at school?
Mm. Well, I couldn'thelp notice your hands
when you wrung out the cloth.
It gave me this feeling
like I was lookingat someone's mother.
A mother?
Uh-huh.
It felt like
how a motherwould wring out a cloth.
Who knows? Maybe you would make
a good housewife later on,Ayanami. (laughs)
Don't be ridiculous.
(insects chirring)
WOMAN (on TV):Don't be ridiculous.
(door opens)
-MISATO: I'm home!-Welcome home!
MISATO:I'm surprised you're notgetting ready for bed.
Hey, don't you havea date tomorrow?
Yep, with a hot guy.
Hey, Misato, can I borrowyour perfume?
The lavender one?
No way.
What? So stingy.
MISATO:That stuff's not for kids.
Is Shinji in his room?
He's been shut in thereall night.
He really doesn't wantto see his father.
He should just say soand get it over with.
It's so Japanese of himto do nothing.
MISATO:It's not as if he absolutelydoesn't want to.
That's why it's so hard for him.
(water running)
GENDOH:Get out!
Good work, Shinji.
MISATO:Shinji?
I'm coming in.
What's wrong? Are you afraid
to be alonewith your father tomorrow?
You can't just run awayall the time.
At some point, you yourselfwill have to take the first step
or nothing will change.
SHINJI:You think I don't know that?
MISATO:Shinji, there'sa lot more to it.
It's not just aboutthe first step.
The steps after can be evenharder, so it's about willpower.
Tomorrow I want you to at leastkeep your chin up.
Remember, you're goingto see your mother, too.
All right? Good night.
- (water shuts off)-(door slides shut)
(Shinji groans)
ASUKA (gasps):Did you buy a new outfit
for tomorrow night?Can I see it?
MISATO:I did. It wasvery expensive, too.
ASUKA:Well, I say style trumps price.
MISATO:No argument there.Style over price.
ASUKA:Do you look for stuffMr. Kaji likes?
Is that how you pickedthis one out?
MISATO:No, I don't do that anymore.
THE NEXT DAY
-Right.-I'm off.
-Goodbye.-(squawks)
(Mendelssohn's "Wedding March"playing)
(chatter, laughter,and camera shutters clicking)
Always remember,happy wife, happy life.
(singing in Japanese)
MAN AT MICROPHONE:And now, please enjoyyour dinner.
(blowing air)
(blowing air)
-Looks like Ryoji'srunning late.-Of course he is.
That idiot hasn'tshown up on time
for anything in his entire life.
Back when you weredating him, sure,
but he's different in his work.
KAJI:Sorry I'm late.
You two lookexceptionally beautiful today.
I got caught tying upsome loose ends at work.
I didn't realize standingaround, doing nothing was work.
I couldn't care lessabout your appearance,
but would it kill youto shave once in a while?
And speaking oftying up loose ends...
Oh. Uh, thanks for that.
You two are likean old, married couple.
You know, I thinkshe's on to something.
I'd never with this jerk.
(wind blowing)
It's been three years sincewe've been here together.
SHINJI:Three years.
I ran away back then.I haven't been back since.
It's still so hard to believethat Mother's resting here.
I don't even remember her face.
People must be able to forgetmemories to go on living.
However, there are some thingsyou must never forget.
Yui taught me that veryimportant lesson many years ago.
To remind myself of that,
I make the journeyhere to her grave.
Are there any photographsof Mom?
No. None exist.
This grave itself is a facade.There's no body.
I was toldyou threw everything away.
They were right, I guess.
GENDOH:You keep what's importantinside of you.
That's enough for now.
(whooshing)
Our time is up.I need to go now.
Father!
I, um... I'm gladwe got to talk.
This was great, Father.
I see.
(classical cello playing)
>?
(snoring)
>?
-(stops playing)-(clapping)
SHINJI:Huh?
Not bad at all, Shinji.
I didn't even knowyou had a cello.
Yeah. I started when I was five,
but that's the best I can do.
I'm not actually talentedor anything.
ASUKA:Perseverance is power.
That's mildly impressive.
SHINJI:A teacher of minesuggested I pick it up.
I could have stoppedwhenever I wanted.
ASUKA:Then why didn't you stop?
Because no one ever told meto stop playing.
-And that's typical.-You're back early.
I thought you'd be out late,grabbing dinner with them.
ASUKA:That date was so boring.
He was so boring, in fact,I ditched him
while we were in linefor the roller coaster
and just came home.
That's pretty mean,don't you think?
Eh! The only decent guy aroundis Mr. Kaji.
What are you saying?Don't bring that into this.
I'll be right back.Heading to the girls' room.
You're not gonna bail, are you?
(grunts)
KAJI:High heels.
When was the last time
we all got together for a drink?
I think Misato's had enough.
She seems a little too bubbly.
Actually, she's drinkingto calm herself down
so she doesn't lose control.It's just her way.
You certainly sound like youknow what you're talking about,
but I guess you did livewith her, after all.
That's true, but that was also
before she startedwearing high heels,
so what do I know?
I never would have imagined
she'd turn out like thisafter college.
I was a brat back then.
Living togetheris putting it too kindly.
We were basically roommates,playing married.
Life's more complicatedthan that.
Oh, I picked upthis souvenir for you.
My, how thoughtful. Thank you.
To women, yes.Work's another story.
Is that so? And Misato?
That is a long-lost battle,
and I don't pick fightsI can't win.
RITSUKO:I think you have a good chance.
KAJI:What about you, Ri?
I make it a pointnot to talk about myself,
'cause there's no fun in that.
What's taking so long?
Is she fixing her makeupor something?
RITSUKO:So, what were youdoing in Kyoto?
Huh? Oh, I picked that upin Matsushiro.
RITSUKO:Don't play dumb with me.
If you dig too deep,you'll get burned.
This is advicefrom a concerned friend.
KAJI:I'll keep that in mind.If I'm gonna get burned,
I'd rather it be whilehaving fun with you.
MISATO:Then maybe I should buysome matches.
Welcome back.
MISATO:Still flirting.
You haven't changed at all.
Of course I've changed.
I've had to adapt to survive.
You know what I mean.
RITSUKO:Homeostasisand transistasis, hmm?
Huh? What's that?
The innate ability to evolve
and the determinationnot to do so.
Every living creature on Earth
carries these two contradictingqualities within themselves.
Sounds like men and women.
Okay, I've got to run off now.
I still have some work to do.
-Really?-Mm.
That's too bad.
Good night.
Okay. Good night.
>?
(phone rings)
MISATO:Hey, Shinji. It's me.
I'm out drinking with Kajiat an after-after-party.
Sure. Right. Night.
-Was it Misato?-Yeah. She said she'll be late,
so we shouldn't wait up for her.
What? She didn't say
she was gonna stay outall night, did she?
Don't think so.
I mean, she's with Mr. Kaiji.
That's why she'd stay out.
You're a total idiot.
(crickets chirping)
KAJI:You're too oldto be throwing up.
MISATO:Well, I'm sorryfor being too old.
We're both too old for this.
Got that right.
High heels and everything.
You're so adult now.
It really makes mefeel the years.
MISATO:You should shave.
Too stubbly.
KAJI:I know.
MISATO:I can walk. Thanks.
KAJI:Sure.
(crickets chirping)
MISATO:Kaji, do you thinkI've changed?
KAJI:You're more beautiful.
MISATO:I never apologized
for how suddenlyI broke up with you.
That part aboutfinding someone else,
it was a lie.
Did you know?
KAJI:No.
It just hit me.
You remind me so muchof my father, Kaji.
When I realizedthat I had found my father
in the man I was dating,
I didn't know what to do.I just couldn't...
All I knewwas that I was terrified.
These feelingskept building up in me,
being with you,about being a woman.
All of itjust scared me to death.
I had looked for someonejust like my father,
a man that I hated so much,so I joined NERV,
thinking maybe I couldput all this behind me,
but NERV was wheremy father had worked.
I was just deceiving myselfby thinking I had joined
to get revengeagainst the Angels.
(sighs)
KAJI:You made your choice,Katsuragi.
You don't have to apologize.
No, that's the problem.I didn't choose.
All I did was run.
I just wanted to run awayfrom my father's curse.
I'm no different from Shinji.
I'm such a coward.
I'm sorry, Kaji.
I'm dumping all this on youbecause I'm drunk.
-That's enough.-I'm a child.
-How could I evertalk down to Shinji?-That's enough.
All I ever do is look for helpin men when it's convenient.
I'm doing it right now.I have no shame at all.
Even back then, Ryoji, I wasusing you the whole time.
-I-- I hate myself!-Stop it! That's enough!
I'm hopeless.I know I'm hopeless. I...
(shoes clatter)
Hey, Shinji,do you want to try a kiss?
Huh? What'd you say?
Kissing, you know?You've never done it, right?
Mm.
Then, let's do it.
(gasps) But wait. Why?
'Cause I'm bored. That's why.
That's not a good reason...to kiss.
Do you feel guiltykissing a girl
on the anniversaryof your mother's death?
Worried that Mommy would belooking at you from heaven?
-That's not it.-Oh, so you're afraid.
I'm not afraid.It's just kissing.
Good. Have youbrushed your teeth?
-Yes.-Well, get ready.
(music playing faintlyover earbuds)
(Shinji gasps)
ASUKA:Don't breathe through your nose.It tickles.
SHINJI:Uh! Oh!
(yawns)
(squawks quizzically)
(humming)
(beeps)
(squawks)
(Shinji gulps)
(gasps for air)
(exhales)
(folding door clatters)
Huh?
(Asuka gargling)
SHINJI:What?
ASUKA:Bleh!
This isn't something you do
just 'cause you're bored!
(gargling)
Okay, you're home.
Get it together.
MISATO:Thank you.
Mr. Kaji.
ASUKA:Really?
Hi, Mr. Kaji!
(Misato snoring)
All right, I'm gonna take off.
It's late.Why don't you stay the night?
I'd be the laughingstock if theysaw me go to work in this.
Come on. No one would mind.
Mr. Kaji, please won't youstay the night here?
KAJI (laughs):I'll see you later.
That smell-- lavender.
KAJI:You two take good careof Katsuragi for me, all right?
SHINJI:Sure thing.
KAJL:Right. Good night.
SHINJI:Good night.
(beeps)
What's up?You look bummed or something.
I kissed you!That's why I'm bummed! Geez!
THE NEXT DAY
TEACHER:Well, let's have oneof our female students read.
Ayanami? Oh, right.
She's absent again, isn't she?
NERV HQ
DEEP UNDERGROUND FACILITY CENTRAL SECTION

(beeping)
-(rapid beeping)-(gun cocks)
So, how's that hangovertreating you this morning?
-It cleared up, thanks to you.-I'm glad to hear it.
So, tell me,is this your real job
or is thisjust a part-time thing?
-Couldn't say.-Member of the Departmentof Special Inspection,
Special Agency NERV,and also the Ryoji Kaji
of the Departmentof Investigation,
Japanese Home Ministry.
You know everything.
Don't underestimate NERV.
Did Commander lkari send you?
I'm here on my own.
This side hustlewill get you killed, trust me.
Commander Ikari is using me.I can keep going.
Although I will apologizefor deceiving you, Katsuragi.
MISATO:After yesterday,we'll call it even.
KAJI:Fine, then.But Commander Ikari and Ritsuko
are deceiving you as well,
and this will prove it.
(beeps)
(clanging and whirring)
Wait. What?
Eva! No, it can't be!
KAJI:Itis.
What started the Second Impact
as well as the lynchpinand initiator
of everythingsince then... Adam.
MISATO:Adam?
What's the First Angeldoing here?
So, it seems there's more toNERV than I originally thought.

(Asuka humming)
(giggles)
(slurping)
Wait a sec, Shinji.Did you change the stock?
Yes, that's bonito stock.
It's from Ms. Ritsuko's gift.
(Asuka screaming)
(water splashing)
(quick footsteps approaching)
Water's too hot!
Sorry.
(groans)You apologize too easily.
Do you even really mean itwhen you say it?
-Yes.-Shinji, do you realize
that you have a habitof apologizing?
It's as ifyou're always doing it
to try to avoid criticism.
-I'm sorry.-See?
That's exactly what I mean!
You're way toointropunitive.
Now, now, Asuka.
That's just how Shinjihandles life.
You're way too accepting,Misato!
Don't you thinkyou're coddling him too much?
You're treating himlike he's a baby.
-Really?-You got back together
with Mr. Kaiji,and now you're pushing
your happiness vibeon everyone.
-(phone ringing)-MISATO: Nothing's going on
between Kaji and me.
(phone beeps)
RYOJI:Hey, Katsuragi.
I found this placethat serves great booze.
-You free tonight?-(phone clicks)
Ah...
Sure, I'll admit it,I've never gotten
into an indecent relationshipwith someone.
But you turn aroundto pretend to be
a chaste guardian?You hypocrite.
I wanna puke!
EPISODE 16: THE SICKNESS UNTO DEATH, AND THEN...
WOMAN:Type B harmonics test,results nominal.
MAN:Adjustment valuesare all green.
Pardon me for saying,but you seem really tired today.
Stuff happens outside of work.
-Kaji stuff?-Don't go there!
Anyway,how's the Third Children doing?
-Here, have a look.-Let's see.
(chirping)
Oh!It'd be nice if this gave him
more confidence in himself.
Shinji, can you hear me?
Ms. Misato!
How did I doon the test just now, huh?
Congrats, you're number one!
ASUKA:Can you believe it?
He surpassed us, just like that.
I gotta be honest,it kinda ticks me off
when he does it so effortlessly.
"Oh, Shinji, you're amazing.
So strong. Too strong.You're the uber-man!"
Well, at least nowwe can slack off a little.
Isn't it great?
But we have to be careful.
We better watch our backsor he'll leave us
in his dust, won't he?
Farewell.

WOMAN:Evacuation of Nishi wardin five minutes.
MAN:Target is advancingat 2.5 kilometers per hour.
-You're tardy.-I'm sorry.
What happened to the radar siteon Mount Fuji?
It wasn't on their scopes.
This thing appeared up aboveout of nowhere.
Pattern orange.No A.T. Field has been detected.
-What does that mean?-A new Angel?
The Magi is holding backon any assessment.
MISATO: Damn it.Of course Commander Ikari
would be absentat a time like this.
MISATO:Pilots, can you hear me?
We've sent you everythingwe know about the target.
I know it's not much to go on.
So, approach the targetwith caution
and gauge how it reacts.
If possible, you are to lure itout of the city's airspace.
One of you will lead,and the rest will provide cover.
-Understood?-Oh, Ms. Katsuragi?
I think Shinji should be the one
to take the lead positionfor this.
-Huh?-This is a job
for the one on the honor roll,
the one who's boldand courageous,
the man who scoredthe highest Sync rate.
Don't you think so?
Or maybe you don't havethe confidence, Shinji.
-SHINJI: I can do it.-ASUKA: Wait, what?
SHINJI:I'll show youhow it's done, Asuka.
ASUKA:Uh, what did you just say?!
All right, cool your jets,both of you.
You said it yourself,didn't you?
"Congrats, you're number one."
Well, yeah, but that was...
After all,fighting is a man's job.
ASUKA:How antiquated.
Unit 02 will provide cover.
REI:Unit 00 will also provide cover.
They're getting pretty cocky.
But Shinji being braveris a good thing, right?
Absolutely not.
He's gonna needa good talking to.
I see.
You're his guardian,so you know best.
STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARED: ROAD CLOSED TO GENERAL VEHICLES
Ayanami, Asuka,what are your current positions?
REI:Not there yet.
There's no way to coverthat much ground so quickly...
-(bangigin-Ah! 9
(grunts)
Come on.
All right.Guess I should pin him down.
-It's gone?- (beeping)
-What is it?-Angel located, pattern blue.
It's right below.
SHINJI:What is this shadow?
What is happening?It doesn't make sense!
MISATO:Shinji, get out of there!Shinji!
-Shinji!-Get out of there, you idiot!
(Shinji screaming)
SHINJI:Ms. Misato, what's going on?
Ms. Misato! Asuka! Ayanami!Help me!
-Ms. Misato, can you hear me?-Eject entry plug.
Send the signal.
Negative.There is no response.
SHINJI:Ms. Misato! Ms. Misato!
Shinji, no!
Asuka, Rei, rescue Unit 01.Hurry!
That idiot.It's not enough
to get good gradeson the trial tests.
-It's gone again.-Asuka, watch out!
That shadow!
Oh, no!
(gasps)The city is...
MISATO:Asuka, Rei, retreat.
-What?!-REI: Wait.
Shinji and Unit 01 are still...
Withdraw.That's an order.
MAYA:This must be roughon Major Katsuragi.
RITSUKO:When we reeled inthe umbilical cable,
there was nothingat the end of it.
-MAYA: Then that means...-RITSUKO: There's not much left
in the internal batteries.
If Shinjidoesn't operate the Eva
and just focuseson staying alive
by switchingto Life Support Mode,
that will give him 16 hours.
(bell tolling)
MAN:Second Tank PlatoonIs in position.
WOMAN:Roger, hold current positionand stand by.
MAN 2:Opening sub-laser comm line.Send specs.
MAN 3:Affirmative,broadcasting on Line Charlie.
U.N. Forces have nowsecured the perimeter.
-The shadow?-No movement.
Shadow grew to 600 metersin diameter and then stopped.
It's been frozen since.
But how exactlyare ground forces
going to be useful against that?
They're just putting ona show of their strength.
-It's all for us.-ASUKA: What a mess!
Going out on his own,not coordinating actions.
He had this coming to him.
Getting all cocky 'causehis test results were good.
"I'll show youhow it's done," huh?
Ha-ha, the pride comesbefore the fall.
What?
Are you getting in my face
because I was bad-mouthingShinji?
Tell me,do you pilot your Eva
to be praised by others?
No, I don't.Not by others, by me!
I praise myself for what I do.
MISATO:Rei, Asuka, stop it right now.
It's true he went outon his own.
That's why I'll needto scold him when he gets back.
(mechanical humming)
I never thoughtit would be possible
to feel so tiredjust from sleeping.
It's totally blank like before.
This space must be so big
that the radarisn't bouncing back.
It's been 12 hourssince I switched
to Life Support Mode.
(sighs)
Guess that means I haveabout four hours left.
So hungry.
MISATO:So, that shadowis the Angel's main body?
Correct. The Angelis three nanometers thick
with a diameter of 680 meters.
That extremely thin spaceis supported
by an inward A.T. Field,
creating an imaginarynumber space, the Dirac Sea.
It's probably connectedto another universe.
And what about the sphere?
It disappears as the main bodybecomes the Dirac Sea.
That object floating aboveis the true shadow.
So, our targetis the black shadow
that enveloped Unit 01.
Then that meansthere's nothing we can do.
(gasps lightly)
The water is murky.
The purification functionmust be failing.
It's starting to stink.
Blood!I smell blood!
No!I don't wanna be here anymore!
Why isn't the hatch unlocking?!
-(banging)-Open up! Get me out of here!
Ms. Misato, what's going on?
Ms. Misato!Asuka! Ayanami!
Ms. Ritsuko...Father...
(sobbing)
Somebody... please help me.
A forceable salvage mission?
It's the only plausible optionthat's available to us.
We drop our entire stockof 992 N2 mines at its center.
With precise timing,the remaining Eva units
employ their A.T. Fieldsto interfere
with the Angel'simaginary number circuit
for one millisecond.
At that instant,we focus the explosive energy
to destroy the Angel,
along with the Dirac Seathat forms it.
MISATO:But the Eva's bodycouldn't withstand it.
What would happen to Shinji?
What kind of rescue missionis this?
RITSUKO:Top priority in this mission
will be placed on the recoveryof Unit 01.
Damage to the Evawill be acceptable.
Hold on, now!
Whether or notthe pilot survives
is immaterial.
(helicopter whirring)
Shinji's loss is a resultof your negligence.
Don't ever forget that.
Why are you and Commander Ikari
so adamant about savingEva Unit 01?
What are the Evas?
I've given youall the relevant information.
Liar.
(police sirens wailing)
Misato, please trust me.
As of right now,I will take command
of this entire operation.
Route the flightthrough KIX as well.
Please contact the ACCand strategic airlift command.
MAN:Roger.
MISATO:The Second Impact,
the Instrumentality Project,Adam.
I'm still left in the darkon too many things.
(train rumbling)
SHINJI:Who is it?
(alarm wailing, increasing)
(alarm dopplers, fading)
Who are you?
-Shinji Ikari.-But that's me.
Iam you.
People have another oneof themselves inside.
Who you are is always comprisedof two of yourselves.
-Two?-The self that is seen by others
and the self that observesthat act.
There are multiplesof the individual named
"Shinji Ikari."
There's the Shinji Ikariinside yourself,
the Shinji insideMisato Katsuragi,
the Shinji inside Asuka,the Shinji inside Rei Ayanami,
the Shinji inside Gendoh.
They're all differentShinji Ikaris,
but they are allgenuine Shinji Ikaris.
You're afraid ofthe Shinji Ikari
that's inside others.
I'm afraid of beingdisliked by others.
You're afraid of you,yourself, being hurt.
Whose fault is that?
This is all Father's fault.
It's his faultbecause he left me.
It's my fault.
There you go again,
rushing to takeall of the blame.
That's what I meanabout being intropunitive!
SHINJI:It's because I can't doanything right.
Isn't it just you who thinksyou can't do anything?
REI:Don't you haveany faith in your father?
SHINJI:I think I don't like him,
but I'm not sure right now.
GENDOH:Good work, Shinji.
SHINJI:Father called me by my name.
My father, he actuallypraised me.
Are you going to recallthat one moment of happiness
for the rest of your life?
I'll be able to go onif I can believe those words.
While deceiving yourself?
Everyone does that.
Everyone does thatin order to go on.
But you need to believein yourself for who you are,
or else you won'tbe able to go on.
This world is fullof too many painful things
for me to live in it.
Like how you can't swim?
Human beings aren't designedto be able to float!
That's self-deceit.
Call it whatever you want.
So far, you've avoidedbad things in your life
by covering your eyes and ears.
KENSUKE:In the last battle,his kid sister...
MISATO:What others thinkisn't important!
-GENDOH: Get out!-No! I don't wanna hear this!
See?Now you're running again.
We can't just pick outenjoyable times in our lives
to daisy-chain together.
Especially not me.
I found something I enjoy.
Finding something enjoyable,
finding somethingand doing that all the time,
what's wrong with that?!
(beeping)
MAKOTO:Theoretically,the entry plug's backup power
should be running outpretty soon.
MAYA:His plug suit's life support
should be in the red zoneby now.
We'll speed the schedule upby 12 minutes.
Let's start nowwhile there's still a chance
Shinji is alive in there.
>?
SHINJI:Father, am I an unwanted child?
Father!
You ran away all on your own.
MAN:That's right,he's under suspicion
for killing his own wife.
MAN 2:He killed his own wife.
SHINJI: No!Mother was smiling back then.
MISATO:People will thank youand praise you for your work.
GENDOH:Shinji, running away isn't good.
MISATO:Keep it up.
SHINJI:Get me out of here.
I don't want to be...
...alone.
The heatingand oxygen circulation
has cut out.
(shivering)So cold.
- (beeping)-It's no use.
The suit is giving out now.
Guess that's it.
I'm so tired...
...of everything.
>?
Mom?
YUI:You'll be okay.
Oh?I'm glad to hear it.
SHIGERU:Both Eva unitsare in position.
MAYA:A.T. Field deployment is ready.
RITSUKO:Roger.
MAKOTO:60 seconds to mine drop.
(explosion)
Hey, what's happening?
-Sitrep now!-I'm at a loss.
MAYA:All the metersand gauges are at maximum.
But we haven'tdone anything yet.
-Does that mean Shinji...-RITSUKO: Impossible.
Unit 01's completelydrained of energy.
(rumbling)
(gasps)
(roaring)
(roaring continues)
Am I pilotinga horrible thing like that?
Unbelievable.
What kind of monstrositydid we replicate?
MISATO:I know the Eva's not just
some simple copyof the first Angel.
But, what will NERVdo with the Evas
once all the Angelsare defeated?
(growling)
(water splashing lightly)
MISATO:Shinji... Shinji...
Shinji!
Are you all right?
Come on, answer me!Shinji!
(sobbing)
I just wanted to getto see you one more time.
(continues sobbing)
I thought you were goingto scold him.
RITSUKO:I've never feltmore afraid of an Eva
than I did today.
Are the Evas really our allies?
I worry that they despise us.
Major Katsuragimight be starting
to suspect something.
I see.It's fine for now.
If Rei or Shinjiever found out
the secret of the Evas,
they would probablynever forgive us.
(sighs)
Just rest today.
We'll take care of things.
Uh, thanks.But I feel fine, really.
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
(gasps)
(grunts)
Mm...
(laughing)
(sniffing)
I can't get rid of the blood.

KEEL:Major Katsuragi, we understand
you refuse to allowthe interrogation
of the only actual participantin this incident,
the pilot of Unit 01.
MISATO:Yes, sir.
His emotional stateis far too unstable.
It would not bein our best interest
to have him stand here.
MR. GREEN:Then we'll directour inquiry to you
as his representative.
MR. YELLOW:Tell me, is it plausible
the Angels were attemptingto establish communication
with mankind in this incident?
MISATO:I did not get that impression
from reviewingthe subject's report.
My assessment isthis was a freak accident.
MR. RED:You assume his memoriesof this incident are accurate.
MISATO:His memory has no signsof alterations
by external factors.
MR. RED:The Eva's AC recorderwas off-line.
We cannot confirm anything.
MR. BLUE:Could it be the Angelbecame interested
in the human psyche,what the heart feels?
MISATO:I cannot confidentlyanswer that question.
Do Angels possessthe facility for sentience?
Can they understandhuman thought?
We don't know the answersto these questions.
MR. GREEN:This incident has a new element.
The Angel attemptedto incorporate an Eva
within itself.
Our projections indicatethere'll be attacks
from a 13th Angel and beyond.
Is this a preludeof things to come?
MISATO:Our analysisof their behavioral patterns
indicate the Angelsdo not coordinate their actions.
MR. YELLOW:Indeed. It is clear they act
independently from one another,at least until now.
MISATO:What do you mean by that, sir?
KEEL:You are not permittedto ask questions.
-MISATO: Yes, sir.-KEEL: That is all.
-You may go.-Sir.
KEEL:What are your thoughts, Ikari?
GENDOH:The Angels are becomingmore clever
and cunning,which means our time...
KEEL:Is running short, correct?
(chimes)
WOMAN 1:You mean the patientin Room 12?
WOMAN 2:She was rushed induring that E Incident, right?
She's been here a long time.
WOMAN 3:Her injuryis very difficult to treat.
WOMAN 2:She's still in grade school.
WOMAN 1:Is her older brother here again?
WOMAN 3:Yeah, he's here.
He comes twice a week, at least.
He's so kind.
He cares so muchfor his little sister.
WOMAN 2:Aw, there aren't enough boys
that act like that these days.
(knocking)
GENDOH:Rei, are you finished for today?
Yes. And tomorrow,
I will go see Dr. Akagi.
I'll go to schoolthe day after that.
GENDOH:How is school?
There are no problems.
I see.That's fine then.
HIKARI:All rise.
Bow, and sit.
Ah, so today's absences
are the usual,Ayanami and Aida.
Hey, what's with Kensuke?
Headed to New Yokosuka.
Had to check outa battleship again.
Something about the Myokobeing in port.
TEACHER:Suzuhara.
Uh, yes, sir?
Please make sure to gettoday's printout to Ayanami.
Yes, sir.
-(alarm blaring)- (overlapping chatter)
FUYUTSUKI:Vanished?
You're certain the Second Branchjust vanished?
SHIGERU:Yes, sir, it's been verified.They vanished.
(beeping)
MISATO:What a mess.
MAKOTO: The adminand investigations departments
are going haywire.
General affairswas in full panic mode.
-MISATO: What caused it?-RITSUKO: We still don't know.
The only clue we haveis the footage
from the satellitein stationary orbit.
There's nothing else left.
MAYA:T-minus ten seconds.
Eight, seven, six,
five, four, three,
two, one... contact.
(explosion rumbling)
(static)
RITSUKO:That's horrible.
MAYA:Evangelion Unit 04,
all research labsand all facilities
within the 89-kilometer radiusvanished.
RITSUKO:Along withseveral thousand people.
SHIGERU:Their scheduleleads us to hypothesize
that the accident happenedduring the trials
of the S2 Driverepaired in Germany.
MAYA:Possible causesrange from deficiencies
in the material's strengthto faulty design decisions.
There are 32,768total possibilities.
MISATO:Can't rule out sabotage either.
But this wasn'tan explosive blast.
It vanished, right?It disappeared.
My guess is thatit was swallowed up
by the Dirac Sea,just like Unit 01 was.
So, then what happenedto the S2 Drive?
Poof.The dream along with it.
That happens when you mess withthings you don't understand.
RITSUKO:Our Evas are no different.
MISATO:So, what are they gonna dowith Unit 03?
RITSUKO:We're taking it in.
It seems the U.S. governmentisn't keen
on losingthe First Branch as well.
MISATO:They insisted on the rightto build Unit 03 and 04,
and then they just plowedright ahead.
Now they want usto take care of the Eva
because thingsgot out of control?
How selfish are they?
RITSUKO:Can you blame them?
Who wouldn't get cold feetafter such a catastrophe?
MISATO:So, what aboutthe activation test?
Are we usingthe Dummy Plug this time?
That hasn't been decided.
Here's the Dummy Plug prototype.
Rel's personalityis transplanted within,
but the human heart, the soul,
cannot be digitized.
It's only a faux stand-in,an imitation.
Currently,it is merely a machine
that mimics a pilot's cognition.
GENDOH:It broadcasts signal patternsinto the Eva.
As long as the Eva is deceived
into thinkingthere is a pilot inside
and synchronizes with it,it's enough.
Have the data inputinto Unit 01 and 02.
There are issuesthat still have to be resolved.
No matter.
-Make it operational.-Sir.
GENDOH:The U.N. has been entrusted
with the transportationof the Eva.
It should arrive this weekend.
Take care of the rest.
RITSUKO:Yes, sir.
Our adjustmentsand the activation trial
will take place at Matsushiro.
GENDOH:Who will be the test pilot?
RITSUKO:The Dummy Plugis still dangerous.
We should reviewthe candidates list.
And decide the Fourth Children.
Yes.There is one candidate
for which the corecould be prepared right away.
-GENDOH: Take care of it.-RITSUKO: Yes, sir.
GENDOH:Rei, you can finish now.
-Yes.-Let's have a meal.
Yes, sir.
(bell tolling)
HIKARI:All rise. Bow.
TOKI:Lunchtime is the best!
I swear, it's the only goodreason for coming to school.
-ASUKA: What?!-Hmm?
You seriously didn't bringlunch for me today?!
Well, I-I hada lot of homework yesterday.
-I just didn't have time.-l1 don't care
about your homework,that's no excuse!
How dare youdeprive me of my lunch?!
Oh, look.
Class lovebirds are at it again.
(students laughing)
BOTH:We're not lovebirds!
MISATO:So, what did you wantto talk about?
RITSUKO:The fourth pilotwill be the test pilot
for Unit 03's activation testat Matsushiro.
Fourth pilot?
When did they findthe Fourth Children?
Yesterday.
I didn't get a report yetfrom the Marduk Institute.
Official documentationwill arrive tomorrow.
(scoffs)
Dr. Ikagi, what are youhiding from me this time?
-Nothing.-Fine, then.
All right, so who's the childthey picked out?
(computer whirring, beeps)
(scoffs)That's the one?
It had to be him?
RITSUKO:What can be done?
We did gather all the candidatesto be safe.
MISATO:It won't be easyto share this with Shinji.
Asuka's pride is what drives herto be an Eva pilot.
Rei is also an exception.
But for everyone else,nothing good can come
from being associatedwith us and the Evas.
Shinji knows more about thatthan anyone else.
I don't wanna make thingsharder for him
than they already are.
Yes, I understand.
But we still needthese children for our work
to ensure that we all survive.
Drop the moralizing.Are we done?
(bell tolling)
(students chattering)
Hey, you're on dutythis week, Suzuhara,
-so don't forget.-Don't forget what?
The printouts, for a start.
The printouts, for a start.
The teacher said you'resupposed to deliver them.
Cool it, class rep.
The girl on duty'll do it.
Ms. Ayanami is absent today.
Oh, she's on duty with me?What a coincidence.
Still, I'm not about to goto a girl's place by myself.
Oh. Well, in that case,I can go with...
Shinji!
Walk home with me.
Uh...
(door closing)
Vang,
Ayanami, I'm coming in.
Going into a girl's placewithout an invite
is not a good idea.
What choice do I have?
She'll just ignore itif you leave it there.
Sorry for intruding.
TOHJI:Whoa.
This is a girl's room?
It's Spartan as hell.
BULLETIN
(paper rustling)
Don't think she'd appreciateyou messing with her stuff.
I'm just cleaning up a little.
Well, I'll have no part of it.
A man does not clean up.
Hmm... I don't think Ms. Misatowould like hearing that.
(gasps)I don't care.
This is a matter of principles.
I have to say,it's a big change.
-What is?-You, man.
Hmm?
To be completely honest,back when I first met you,
I thought you were a real SOB.
I didn't thinkthat you were the type
that'd go out of your wayto help others.
But, guess that all changed
after you learned the ropesand eased up a bit.
Hmm.
(door opening)
-Don't mind us.-What is it?
I brought a bunchof printouts for you.
Sorry.I tidied up a bit.
I just collectedthe trash for you.
Uh... thank you.
(bird cawing)
TOHJI:All right,I'm just gonna say it.
All the Eva pilotsare a little wackadoo.
"Thank you."Words of gratitude.
Man's first words.
Words I've never spoken to him.
FUYUTSUKI:The city, man's artificialparadise on Earth.
GENDOH:Man was driven outof the Garden of Eden
and forced to flee into a world
where death could comeat any moment.
Being the weakest of life-forms,
that weakness instilledupon him intellect,
and with that,he created his own Eden.
In his quest to insulatethe fear of death
and satisfyselfish carnal desires,
mankind has builta paradise for himself.
This city is a stellar exampleof that--
an armed citybuilt for protection.
GENDOH:It's a refuge to cowards,
those who run awayfrom their enemies.
Cowards endureand tend to live longer.
No shame in that.
Tokyo-3, NERV's facade
Angel interceptionfortress city.
The belatedseventh construction stage
is coming to an end.
It seems the cityis finally complete.
What will you reportto the council
regarding the accidentwith Unit 04?
GENDOH:Report the facts.
The cause remains unknown.
Still, it was a monumentalloss to bear.
That and the Second Branchmatter little.
Even if the S2 Driveand the samples are lost,
the data is safe and securein Germany.
As long as Tokyo-3 and Unit 01are safe, we're fine.
But the council is verydisturbed by this development.
It was an unprecedentedincident.
Seele must be working feverishly
to rework the action plan.
GENDOH:Incidents not predicted
in the Dead Sea Scrollswill happen.
Those old menneeded that lesson.
KAJI:This place's interception system
is finally reaching completion.
You'd thinkthey'd throw a party,
or at least buy a cake.
NERV is so stuffy.
MAYA: You knowhow Commander Ikari is.
And how might you be?
Wait, what are you trying to do?
I will speak to Ms. Katsuragiand Dr. Akagi about this.
Guess I'll have to keepthat mouth of yours busy.
MISATO:How's work going?Any problems?
Work's working away,you know how it is.
Speaking of work,I have some to get to, so...
MISATO:It's none of my businessto stick my nose
into your private life.
But would you mindnot messing with her
during this emergency?
She's not underyour command, right?
How 'bout I mess with you?
That depends on whatyou say next.
You know the secretsabout Adam underground
and the Marduk Institute,don't you?
-Do I?-Enough, don't play dumb.
It's not like youto ask for help.
Believe me,this isn't by choice.
That's a luxury I don't have.
The timing was too perfectfor the Fourth Children
to be discovered.What's going on?
I'll share this tidbit.
The Marduk Institutedoesn't exist.
NERY itself arrangedall this to happen.
NERV itself?Commander Ikari?
Look up Code 707.
Seven-zero-se... wait.
That's Shinji's school,isn't it?
-Ms. Misato?-Yes?
Ms. Ritsukowanted to talk to you
about a triptaking place tomorrow.
Right, thanks, Shinji.
-Till next time.-Sure thing, boss.
Have tea with me.It'll be fun.
But I'm not a girl.
SHINJI:You know,you're not as respectable
as I thought, Mr. Kaji.
KAJI:Geez, you're a lot more frank
when you're feelingat ease, Shinji.
SHINJI:Oh, I... sorry.
KAJI:Nah, I shouldbe the one apologizing.
Didn't mean it to be critical.
Hey, let me show yousomething special.
Are these... watermelons?
Yep.Cute, huh?
This is my hobby.
But don't tell anyone, okay?
Making and growing thingsare great hobbies.
You learn to notice thingsyou never noticed before.
Things that make you happy.
And hurtful things too, right?
KAJI:You don't like being hurt?
SHINJI:I don't care much for it.
KAJI:Is there anythingthat makes you happy?
It's okay.
Look, knowing abouthurtful things
only makes a person more caring,
and caring is not the sameas being weak.
(phone ringing)
Yeah, hello?
Katsuragi's saying they wannado a Sync test right now.
RITSUKO:Now I'm certain of it.
Shinji's synchronization ratesare lower.
-So, why is that?-It could be anything.
Although I suspectthat something happened
during the previous incident,something psychological.
Telling himabout Unit 03's pilot
is gonna be harder.
RITSUKO:Well, the pilot himself
will be officially informedtomorrow.
(Misato sighs)
-(bell tolling)-HIKARI: All rise.
Attention. Bow.
(yawning)I can't wait for lunch.
MAN (over P.A.):Tohji Suzuhara, come tothe principal's office
-immediately.-Wait, what?
What'd you do this time?
Mmm, nothing I can think of.
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE
Tohji Suzuhara,present as requested.
(door closes)
RITSUKO:So, you're Tohji Suzuhara.
SHINJI:How was New Yokosuka yesterday?
KENSUKE:It was awesome.
But I caught wind of some info
that is a little concerning.
SHINJI:Eva Unit 03?
KENSUKE:Yeah, the one that wasbeing built in the U.S.
It's finished, right?
SHINJI:I don't know.
KENSUKE: Look, I know you haveto keep this stuff a secret,
but give me something.
SHINJI:I honestly don't know anything.
KENSUKE:Well, have you heard the rumors
about an activation testat the second test site
-at Matsushiro?-No, I haven't.
KENSUKE:Have they decidedon a pilot yet?
SHINJI:I said I don't know anything.
KENSUKE:I wonder if Ms. Misatowould let me do it.
That would be so cool!
Ask her to let me do it, Shinji.
It's my dream to pilot an Eva.
I haven't heardanything about this.
Well, then what about the newsthat Unit 04 was delisted?
Delisted?
Come on, you didn'tknow about that?
Something about it blowing up
along with allof the Second Branch.
Everyone was freaking outat my dad's department.
-Seriously?-Seriously.
Ms. Misatodidn't tell me anything.
Well... then again,
it has nothing to dowith the pilots on the front.
If you weren't told, it justmeans you didn't need to know.
I'm sure that's all it was,Shinji.
Sorry for askingall the questions.
(sighs)
Man, what's taking Tohji so long?
TEACHER:And thus, mankind was ableto rise from the ashes
caused by the hellthat was the Second Impact.
With each passing year,the birthrate
-continues to decline.-(door opens)
Sorry for being late.
They told me.Go ahead and take your seat.
The younger generation-- you--will inherit what will...
(bell tolling)
Come on, let's get out of here.
-Tohji coming?-He's gonna be here late.
He's still on duty.
>?
(woman on P.A.speaking indistinctly)
-Suzuhara?-Yeah?
Um, since you're on dutyfor the week,
be sure to get things in orderand fill in the daily journal.
(sighs)I didn't eat lunch today.
I'll do all that stuffwhen I'm done.
I noticed you always buyyour food at the school shop.
Got no one at homethat'll make it for me, so...
Tohiji, I...
Hmm?
I have an olderand younger sister.
Their names are Kodamaand Nozomi.
I always preparetheir lunch for them.
Sounds like a real pain.
So, I know I might notlook like it,
but I'm actuallypretty good at cooking.
That's nice.
And I usually have some foodleft over when I'm done.
-That's not good. It's a waste.-Huh?
I could eat the leftoversfor you if you want me to.
(gasps) Mm-hmm.Thanks for the help.
WOMAN:Board Three's configurationchange test has been completed.
All transport...
(inhalesdeees d ply)
-Mr. Kaji!-Asuka.
I'm sorry, I'm pretty swampedat the moment.
Come back later.
Hmm?
You have plenty of timeto see Misato.
(sighs)
Hug!(giggles)
Hey! Not now.
Hey, is thisour synchronization data?
Four pilots?
What?What's going on?
How could hebe the Fourth Children?
That's impossible,it doesn't make any sense.
What the hell is going on here?!

Do not deviate from course.Maintain scheduled ETA.

(crackling)
(car horn honking)
Hey, uh, where's Asuka?
She went out ahead already.
I'm pretty sureshe's determined not to see me
-if she can help it.-Why is that?
I guess you haven'treally caught on
to how girls think yet.
-So I...-So I have...
You first, please.
I heard a rumorUnit 04 was delisted.
Is it really true?Something about there being
an accident?
Well, yes, it's all true.
Unit 04, along withall of NERV's second branch,
did completely vanish.
It happened duringthe S2 drive testing.
But we're safe here.
All three Evas aredoing just fine, right?
We've got the best pilotsand staff.
But what about Unit 03coming from the U.S.?
The activation test isat Matsushiro.
MISATO:That's right.I'll have to be away
for four days,but Kaji will look after you.
You guys will have fun.
-But the test is...-Ritsuko will be with me
the whole time.It'll be fine.
SHINJI:What about the pilot?
Yeah... about the pilot...
(intercom chiming)
Huh? Yes?
Good morning, ma'am!
I'm here todayto make a formal request,
Major Katsuragi.
Please let me--Please allow me
to become the pilotof Evangelion Unit 03.
Huh?
EPISODE 18: LIFE AND DEATH DECISIONS
RITSUKO:I take it Shinjistill doesn't know?
No, I never got a chanceto break it to him.
I'm a little worried.
There are momentswhere I just can't figure out
-what he's thinking.-Well, try and pull it together.
You were the one that askedto be his guardian, remember?
Yes, of course I remember.
RITSUKO:So, when will you callfor the pilot?
MISATO:Mm, probably tomorrow.
There's still a lot to prepare.
You know, there's a chancehe'll out himself
-as being chosen.-I doubt that'll happen.
He didn't seem excitedwhen we told him,
so I don't thinkhe'd brag about it.
His only conditionfor becoming a pilot
was that his younger sisterbe transferred
to HQ's medical department.
KENSUKE:Man, Ms. Misato is heartless.
No one wants to bea pilot more than me.
I would even accept beinga standby pilot, right, Toh;ji?
Huh? Sure.
(door opens)
Hey, what's up?You left way earlier than me,
but you're barely on time.
What's wrong?
Trouble in paradisefor the lovebirds?
(groaning)I just wasn't in a rush
to see your stupid faces!Dumb, pea-brained idiot trio!
(supplies clattering)
(bells chiming)
Lunchtime, here we go.
Hey, wait, where's Toh;i?
He left already.
Without eating his lunch?Is that possible?
This is Tohjiwe're talking about.
Oh, he's been actingstrange recently.
-REl: Suzuhara?-Huh?
Oh, it's you, Ayanami.
If you're looking for Shinji,you're out of luck.
I guess you know, don't you?Of course you do.
Seems like Soryu knows, too.
Mm.
TOHJI:Shinji's the only onestill in the dark.
You're acting strange,caring about others.
REI:I don't understandwhat I'm feeling.
It's simple.You're worried about Shinji,
-that's what.-Oh.
Maybe you're right about that.
I know I am.
ASUKA:Hikari? Eat lunch with me!
MISATO:It's about time they show up.
We're only two hoursbehind schedule.
No man has ever made mewait this long
in my entire life.
If this was a date,you would've split by now.
TEACHER:And so, this event isnow referred to
as the Second Impact.
At the time, I was still livingin Nebukawa,
but with the sea levels risingas a consequence
of the Antarctic melting,
Nebukawa sitsat the bottom of the ocean.
-(fist punches flesh)-Aah!
Sorry about that, newbie,
but I had to punch youat least one time,
you know, just to settlethe score with you.
(bells chiming)
Sorry, Asuka, I knowyou usually go home with Shinji.
ASUKA:Oh, it's whatever.
I'm only around himbecause of work.
And I'm not in the mood to seehis dorky face right now.
It's Suzuhara, isn't it?
-Yeah, you can tell?-It's pretty obvious.
I mean, the only peoplestill oblivious are
-the idiot trio.-What about Shinji?
He seems like a sensitive guy.
Ugh!He's the densest one of all!
He's a big dummy, and he doesn'tknow how to talk to people.
HIKARI:Oh.
(bird calling)
I think Suzuhara might beattracted to Ms. Ayanami.
Suzuhara, really? He's gota thing for Ms. Perfect?
They seemed really closeat lunch today.
(scoffs) No, take it from me,Hikari, that is impossible.
Shinji is dense,but Ms. Perfect is
a million times more densethan he is.
-Really?-Really.
Listen, can I ask you something?
-What is it?-What do you see
in that idiot anyway?Seriously?
He's very kind.
Huh?
(distant car horn honking)
WOMAN (on TV):Aah! I knew it!This was a mistake!
I never should've let youget close to me again!
MAN (on TV):How could you say thatafter all we've--
Hey, do you knowanything about...
Mr. Kaji takesreally long baths.
WOMAN:Even if I trippedover this pot...
I keep wonderingwho's gonna pilot Unit 03.
Wait, they haven't told youwho it is yet?
Who is it?
No clue.
(sighing)So refreshing.
Huh? Ugh, are you twofighting again?
For crying out loud.
Are you always like thiswhen Katsuragi isn't around?
Of course not!
I should be ecstatic being able
to spend the nighttogether with you.
I should be happy.
I want to be happy,but I can't.
Not today.
All right, then.
It's time for bed.
At times like this,the best thing is
to hit the hay early.
Are you asleep yet, Mr. Kaji?
No, still up.
Can you tell me what kind ofperson my father is?
I wasn't expectingthat question.
I thought you were gonna askabout Katsuragi.
It just seems like you spenda lot of time with him, so...
You have me confusedwith the deputy commander.
Are you going aroundasking about your father?
SHINJI:We didn't havea lot of time together.
KAJI:Then you don't know much.
SHINJI:But I learned a few things...
about Father and about his work.
About Mother, too.I thought...
I'm telling you you're wrong.
You only thinkyou learned something.
People can neverfully understand others.
Good luck even knowing yourself.
It's impossible to truly grasp.
And yet people arestill compelled to learn
everything they canabout others and themselves.
It's why you neverget bored of life.
At least we have that.
What about Ms. Misato?
Did you know the Japanese wordfor "girlfriend"
is writtenwith the Chinese characters
for "women" and '"faraway"?
A woman is a far-off existence.
A river wider and deeperthan any ocean
separates the two sexes.
SHINJI:I don't understand peoplewho are adults.

That's horrible.What are we gonna do?
Quit whining and focus, damn it!
Getting bent out of shapeover spilled milk

But we're on our ownagainst an Angel.
Commander Ikari ispersonally taking charge of it.

SHINJI:An Angel? That's an Angel?
Yes. That is your target.
That's my target.
But that's a-- that's an Eva!
-(heavy footfalls)-ASUKA: What's going on?
How did an Angeltake over an Eva?
There's someone in there,and they could be
the same age as me.Probably a kid.
Wait, you still don't know?

He's on board.
(roaring)

-(gasping)-The Angel is infiltrating

Pilot injured.
No way.

It's still there.So someone's on board.
(roaring)
(whimpering)
-(straining)-WOMAN: Life support failing!
MAYA:The pilot's life is in danger!
Counter! Lower nerve connection
-to 60%-- hurry up!-Not yet.
But, Ikari, if we don'tlower it, the pilot will die.
Shinji, why aren't you fighting?
Father, there's someoneinside that Eva.
Irrelevant!That is an Angel!
Our enemy, your target!
I can't... I can't do that!
We have to save them!
I cannot just murder someone!
You'll die if you don't.
Fine!That's better than murder.
So be it!
Shut down the synchronization
between Unit 01 and the pilot.
MAYA:A sync shutdown?
GENDOH:That's right. Switch control
to the Dummy plugged in.
But, sir, the Dummy system is
still plagued with issues,and with Dr. Akagi absent, I...
It's still betterthan the current pilot!
-Do it!-Sir.
-(gasping)-(powering down)

What is this?
Father, what did you do?!

-MAN: Hey! Got one over here!A survivor!-(indistinct chatter)
Still breathing!Get the parademics. Hurry!
(distant ambulance sirens)
I'm alive?
-Kaji?-You were very lucky,
Katsuragi.
What about Ritsuko?
Don't worry.She got off easier than you.
I see.
What about Eva Unit 03?
Classified as an Angeland neutralized
by Unit 01.
MISATO:I...
I never told Shinjiwho the pilot was.
(quiet sobs)
-Shinji?-Ms. Misato?
I'm glad you're okay.
Yeah, I made it.
I'm sorry.I need to tell you something
very important.
I never thoughtthis would happen.
Ms. Misato, I let...
I let someone...
Father...
I-I told him to stop, but...
Shinji, I'm sorry.
I am so sorry.
MAYA:Message from the entry plugrecovery team.
The pilot is confirmed alive.
-They're alive?-MISATO: Listen.
The pilot of Unit 03 is...

MAYA:Linkage circuits with Unit 01have been severed.
-Plug eject signal?- (alarm beeping)
It has been locked outby the pilot, sir.
It hasn't been received.
Listen, Shinji,if we hadn't done what we did,
then you would have been killed.
SHINJI:That doesn't matter.
It's the cold, hard truth.
SHINJI:Don't say that.
You'll make me even angrier.
Unit 01 still has185 seconds left.
That's more than enoughto demolish half of HQ.
SHIGERU: In his state of mind,he just might do it.
Listen to me, Shinji,if it hadn't been
for Commander Ikari's decisions,
it's very likely that we allcould've been killed.
I said that doesn't meana damn thing to me!
Father, that brutetried to kill Tohji!
And he used me to do it.
EPISODE 19: A MAN'S BATTLE
Father, you're in there,aren't you?
Say something, Father!Answer me!
GENDOH:Increase LCL pressureto maximum.
-Sir?-I don't have timefor childish tantrums.
I can still usemy direct controls to...
-(electricity whirring)-(groaning)
Damn it.
Damn it. Damn it.
(man speaking indistinctlyover P.A))
(distant sirens)
(footsteps approaching)
-Don't you need rest?-I can do my work.
That's all that mattersright now.
We've got a crisis here.I can't take it easy.
MISATO:How's Shinji?
RITSUKO:They had to use a laser torch
to cut throughthe emergency hatch.
It's the only waythey could remove him.
MISATO:This is a real mess,that's for sure.
ASUKA:He's in real troublethis time.
That idiot won't makea comeback after this, I bet.
Where's Shinji?
Well, he's not physically hurt.
-He'll get up soon.-(monitor beeping steadily)
He's probably just laying theredreaming right now.
-Dreaming?-Yeah, dreams.
You know what those are, right?
-(monitor beeping steadily)-(breathing slowly)
Shinji?
Why am I laying herenext to Shinji?
Where am I? The hospital?
My sister was in...
(beeps fading)
-(bell ringing)-(train passing)
Huh? That's Shinji and Ayanami.
Shinji, why did you dosuch a thing?
I couldn't forgive my father.
I couldn't forgive himfor betraying me.
I finally felt like I couldtalk to him, and he does this.
Father-- doesn't careabout how I feel at all.
Shinji, did you tryto understand
-your father's feelings?-I did try to understand.
Why won't you try to understand?
I tried to! I really did!
So you're just going to run awayfrom the things that hurt you?
So what?!
What's wrong with running awayfrom hurt and pain?!
Geez, what exactly arethose two bickering about?
WOMAN:We've made a specialexception for you.
-Five minutes, okay?-HIKARI: Yes.
Thank you so very much.
(monitor beeping steadily)
Hey, class rep, what's up?
Suzuhara, are you all right?
Yeah, well, I am alive, I guess.
What's the deal?
I thought Shinji wasright over there.
Was I dreaming or something?
They said Shinji was dischargedfrom the hospital yesterday.
Suzuhara, you were asleepfor three whole days.
Really?
Three whole days?
What are you doing here?
Uh, oh, I'm just herefor official business
as the electedclass representative.
It's nothing more than that,really, I swear.
Oh, yeah. Right, I know that.
No, you don't.
I'm really sorry.
I didn't get to eatyour lunches.
Don't worry about that.
But I'm sorry. They told me
I can't bring any lunchboxesfor you to eat in here.
-Class rep?-What is it?
Can I ask you to do something?
-Sure.-Can you tellmy younger sister
-that I'm doing okay?-Okay.
(door opens)
FUYUTSUKI:Come out, Shinji Ikari.
The Supreme Commanderwill see you now.
(echoing clank)
GENDOH:Insubordination.
Personal use of an Eva.
Immature blackmail.
These are all criminal acts.
Do you have somethingto say for yourself?
SHINJI:Yes.
I never want to pilotan Eva again.
I don't want to be here anymore.
-GENDOH: Then get out.-Right.
I'll go backto where you left me.
Are you running away again?
I'm disappointed in you.
I doubt I will see you again.
SHINJI:Yes, I hope so.
(footsteps)
(door hisses, thuds)
(crickets chirping)
GENDOH: It's me. Delete theentry for the Third Children.
Rei will be the defaultdesignated pilot of Unit 01.
The Dummy Plugwill be the backup.
(birds chirping)
(phone ringing)
(phone continues ringing)
(beep)
KENSUKE:Hey, Shinji, is it true
you're leaving Tokyo-3?
It's true, isn't it?
Why? Why are you leaving now?
I was so jealous of you.
I was green with envy.
You're so different from us.
Damn it, even Tohji got to pilotan Eva, and here I am...
(line clicks, rings)
WOMAN:This phone call isbeing monitored.
To maintain security,
this conversationhas been terminated.
Thank you for your cooperation.
(line clicks)
(insects chirping)
SHINJI:Asuka must be angry I'm leaving.
MISATO:Yes. She didn't even ask meto tell you goodbye.
SHINJI:That sounds like her.
I'm actually relieved.
You can't keep tryingto please everyone.
It'll only make thingsharder for you.
That's how you live your life.
I can't do that.
I think you know this already,
but your life isgoing to be restricted
in various ways from now on.
Yes.
-Um...-What is it?
Can I ask one question?
Why was Tohji chosento be the Fourth Children?
Every single one of yourclassmates were candidates
in the fourth roundof selections for Eva pilots.
I just found out recently
that it had all beenprearranged.
All of them?Everyone in my class?
Nothing I could say would beenough to make amends
for how we failed Tohji.
But, Shinji, to be honest,
I pinned all my hopes,aspirations
and sense of purpose on you.
And I know that's beena terrible burden for you.
But we-- all of us at NERV--
we had to entrustour future to you.
Please, Shinji,I want you to remember that.
That's a selfish thing to say.
Yes, I'm aware.
I'm not going to changeyour HQ passcode,
and I'll leave your roomjust as it is.
Don't bother.Please get rid of everything.
I won't ever pilot an Eva again.
(engine starts)
MISATO:He was speaking so assertively.
He's never done that before.
(siren wailing)
WOMAN (over P.A.): Alert.A state of special emergency
has been declaredin and around the Tokai region.
All residents mustimmediately make their way
to the designatedevacuation shelters.
-I repeat...-An angel.
SHIGERU (over P.A.):All personnel,battle stations, condition one!
Ready surface-to-air engagement.
-MAN: What's going on?-Target's currently advancing.
Koma-ga-takedefense lines breached.
-(beeping)-MAN: Armor platesone through 18 are destroyed!
18 layers of special armordestroyed in an instant.
It's too latefor a surface intercept.
Station Unit 02inside the Geo-Front.
Its orders are to defend HQ.
Tell Asuka to strike the target
the moment it entersthe Geo-Front.
Where's Unit 00?
MAYA:Stationed at the A.T. Fieldneutralization point.
Its left arm hasn't beenregenerated yet.
Then combat is impossible.
GENDOH:Rei is to launchinside Unit 01.
Ready the Dummy Plugas a backup.
Sir.
-WOMAN: Begin entry sequence.-MAYA: Ionizing LCL.
WOMAN:Initiate A-10 nerve connection.
- (sharp whoosh)-(retching)
REI:This won't work anymore.
-WOMAN: Pulse reversing.-MAYA: Unit 01 is rejectingall neural connections.
How is this happening?
-lkari.-Yes?
Trying to refuse me, huh?
Abort activation.Have Rei launch in Unit 00.
Employ the Dummy Plugfor Unit 01.
But, sir, Unit 00 is...
-REI: Unit 01, acknowledged.-Rei?
REI:Even if I die,I can be replaced.
SHINJI:I... I said I'd neverpilot an Eva again.
MAN:You there!What are you doing?!
You need to evacuateto a shelter!
Situation critical!One more hit,
and all our armor willbe destroyed!
I'm counting on you, Asuka.
ASUKA:Here it comes.
Even if Shinji isn't here,I can take care of that thing
all by myself--it'll be a piece of cake.
Come on!
-(clicking)-Ugh! Next!
What gives? Its A.T. Fieldshould be neutralized by now!
Why won't you die already?!
I am not gonna lose again,damn it!
Not me!
Huh?No!
(whimpering)
You swine!
Asuka!
Sever allneural connections now!
(gasps)
(soft chatter)
ASUKA:Evacuation training?What an idiot!
We pilots don't haveanything to do
with that kind of stuff.
Aah!
(panicked chatter)
SHIGERU:Rei took a direct hit!
Evacuate Shelter Number Six!
Everyone, headto Shelter Number Three!
Unit 02 is too damaged to fight!
-RITSUKO: How's Asuka?-MAKOTO: She's all right!
She's alive!
(panting)
Damn you.
SHIGERU:The Angel's moving again!
What is the status of Unit 01?
WOMAN:The Dummy Plug's installed.
MAYA:Probe insertion complete!
-Initiate contact.-Roger.
- (beeping)-What?
MAYA:Pulse lost.The Dummy Plug was refused!
No go! Eva Unit 01 willnot activate.
The Dummy Plug... and Rei.
It's refusing both?
Fuyutsuki? You take charge.
MAN:Move the engine to block six!
MAN 2:I can't find my family.
Can someone help me?
- (overlapping shouts)-This way! Come on!
Hurry! Hey, you!You want to die?! Get moving!
Hurry, hurry!
Asuka...
KAJI:Shinji, is that you?
SHINJI:Mr. Kaji?
What are you doing out hereat a time like this?
KAJI:I could saythe same thing to you.
What are you doingout here, Shinji?
SHINJI:I...
I decided to never pilotan Eva again.
I made that decision.
KAJI:I see.
Well, since they found outabout my side job,
I'm no longer allowedto man a combat station.
So, insteadI water these plants.
SHINJI:At a time like this?
KAJI:Especially at a time like this.
I mean, resting my headon Misato's bosom
would be nice, too, butI want to be here when I die.
Die?
Yes. If an Angelever comes into contact
with Adam that sleepsunderneath us,
it's believedthe Third Impact would occur
and mankind would perish.
The only way to stop it isby relying on something
with the same powersas the Angels.
The Evangelions.
Rei? But she doesn'thave a rifle!
(clicks)
-An N2 mine!-Rei!
A.T. Field full power.
(gasps)
Unit 00, no.
Rei!
This is awful.
(shudders)
Listen, Shinji, I can onlystay here and water my plants,
but there is somethingthat you can do.
Something can be done thatonly you have the power to do.
No one's gonna force you.
You need to think about itand decide.
Figure outwhat you need to do right now.
So you don't haveany regrets later, all right?
(crashing)
(panting)
SHIGERU:Number Three foundation hit!
Final armor bulkhead'sdestroyed!
No! The main shaftis totally exposed!
What about Unit 01?
SHIGERU:Dummy Plug refused!
Nothing! No response!
GENDOH:Keep trying.
Start again from one-zero-eight.
SHINJI:Let me get on board!
Please. Please.
Let me pilot Unit 01 again!
Father.
GENDOH:Why are you here?
Because-- because
I'm the pilotof Evangelion Unit 01!
I'm Shinji Ikari!
The Angel is enteringthe main shaft!
It's heading down!
-What's its trajectory?-It's heading
straight towardthe Central Dogma.
It's coming here.Evacuate all personnel.
MAKOTO:All personnel evacuate!
I repeat, evacuate!
(all gasping)
Wait, Eva Unit 01? Shinji!
(screaming)
(screaming)
(screaming)
-Ms. Misato!-Launch Number Five, hurry!
(straining)
(screaming)
(screaming)
-What?-(beep)
There's no power left?
Unit 01 has reachedits operational limit!
-The backups are dead as well!-Shinji!
-(panting)-(gasping)
Shinji, no!
Move! Come on! Move! Move it!
Move! Move, damn it! Come on!
If you don't move now,it's gonna be too late-- aah!
-(booming)-(gasping)
Is that...?
SHINJI:Move! Move! Move!Move! Move!
Move! Move! Move! Move!
Move! Please move!Move it right now!
You've got to move!Got to do this right now!
Or else everyone's gonna die!I don't want that anymore.
So, please, move already!
(soft thumping)
(heartbeat grows)
(whirring)
(growling)
The Eva's been reactivated.
No way.
This can't be.I don't believe this.
Unit 01's synchronization ratehas topped over 400%.
It's happening after all.She's awake.
(roaring)
(panting)
(growling)
(chomping)
Eating... an Angel?
Is Eva Unit 01 ableto ingest the S2 drive...
on its own?
-(growls)-(retches)
-The restraints are...-Restraints?
That's correct. Those aren'tjust armored plates.
Those are restraints we attachedto keep the true powers
of the Eva at bay.
It's breaking freeof our bondage
through its own might.
Humanity has lost the meansof holding back that Eva.
The awakeningand liberation of Unit 01.
I don't thinkSeele is gonna like this.
FUYUTSUKI:Is this all partof the scenario?
Commander Ikari?
-It has begun?-Correct.
Everything is beginning now.

Humanity has lost the meansof holding back that Eva.
-(roaring)-KAJI: The awakeningand liberation of Unit 01.
Not good.
I don't think Seeleis gonna like this.
MR. GREEN:None of the Evas were meantto have the S2 Drive.
MR. RED:Who could have foreseen
that it would assimilate itthis way?
MR. YELLOW:This event deviates greatly
from Seele's scenario.
MR. RED:Adjusting will not be easy.
MR. GREEN:Dare I say that perhaps
entrusting Gendoh Ikari with NERV
was a mistakein the first place.
MR. BLUE:But he was the only man
who could have putour plans into action.
Ikari, what exactlyare you thinking?
-It has begun.-Correct.
-Everything is beginning now.-(Eva 01 roaring)
EPISODE 20: OF THE SHAPES OF HEARTS AND HUMANS
MAYA:The damage to the two Evas
goes beyond the Hayflick limit.
RITSUKO:It's going to take some time
before we can get thingsback in shape.
MAYA:Luckily, it is possible
to transfer the Magi system.
We can begin to workon it immediately.
But this place has had it.
SHIGERU:It's just a matter of time
before they decideto condemn it.
Agreed.In the meantime,
we'll have to use the backupsecondary command center.
MAYA:But we'll have to do itwithout the Magi?
RITSUKO:Yes.
We'll dust the placeand start work
in the afternoon.
MAYA:The chair cushions are hard
and the sensorsaren't as responsive.
It's somewhat uncomfortable.
SHIGERU:Architecture's sameas the first command center,
-but it seems different.-MAYA: It gives youa strange feeling, right?
Yes, but at leastit's operational.
The big questionis whether or not Unit 01 is.
MISATO:Will the cage restraintsbe strong enough?
MAKOTO:No signatures of heat,electrical, chemical,
or electromagnetic energyhave been detected.
The S2 Driveseems completely dormant.
MISATO:And yet, even in this state,
Unit 01 has activatedthree times already.
(roaring)
Messing around with this Eva
based on just what you seeis dangerous.
Foolhardily tampering with it,
not knowing how it could react?
Reminds me of you,Ms. Katsuragi.
Oh... I apologize.
KEEL:But the issues extendfar beyond Eva Unit 01.
MR. YELLOW:Indeed. Severe damageto Unit 00 and Unit 02,
half the HQ facilityis demolished,
the Central DogmaIS now exposed.
It's extensive.
MR. GREEN:We have no ideahow much time and money
we've lost as a resultof this destruction.
MR. RED:This is all becausewe didn't have a bell
around lkari's neck.
MR. GREEN:The bell is there,the problem is it did not ring.
KEEL:There's no point in a bellif it doesn't ring.
We'll make the belltake action next time.
I gotta say, this wasan unexpected development.
How are you planning onexplaining this to the council?
I mean, Seele?
FUYUTSUKI:At the time, Unit 01was outside of our control.
It was an unfortunate accident.
GENDOH:Therefore, Unit 01will be grounded
until further noticefrom the council.
KAJI:I think that'san appropriate policy.
But isn't your son still lostinside Unit 01, sir?
(alarm blaring)
MAYA:Negative, ma'am.
It wouldn't acceptthe Entry Plug ejection signal.
-Backup and simulated?-MAYA: They're being refused.
Can't connect to the directcontrol circuits either.
We now have a visual feedof the plug interior.
Patching throughto the main display.
(all gasp)
That's not possible.
RITSUKO:This is what 400%Sync rate looks like.
MISATO:What do you mean?
What happened to Shinji?
RITSUKO:He's been assimilatedinto Unit 01.
What does that mean?What exactly is an Eva?!
All I can sayis that it's a human,
or something resembling a human,created by human beings.
Created by humans?
But really, all you didwas just copy something
you found in the Antarctic.
Don't make me laughsaying it's an original.
But it's not simply a copy.
A human willhas been infused with it.
So, are you sayingthis is someone's will?
Or the will of the Eva.
(slap echoes)
Fix this, damn it!
You built this thing,didn't you?!
Take responsibilityall the way to the end!
(man speaking indistinctlyover P.A))
I'm still alive.
ASUKA:Fine, so she was uninjured!I got that!
Don't waste my time calling me
to tell me stupid stufflike that, Misato, damn it!
(phone rattling)
(siren wailing outside)
I can't believe it.
I can't believeI couldn't do anything.
Damn idiot Shinjistole the show.
Damn it all!
MISATO:A salvage operationto recover Shinji?
RITSUKO:Yes, what could be said to beShinji's life still exists.
MISATO:Suddenly caring abouta pilot's well-being?
RITSUKO:We're not in a stage wherewe can afford to lose him.
MISATO:Huh, I'll bet NERVis less interested
in Shinji's life than expediting
the reinstatement of Unit 01.
RITSUKO:I won't deny it.
MAYA:We hypothesize Shinji's body
has completely lostthe delineation
of its ego-boundary,and he's floating
in the Entry Plugin a quantum state.
MISATO:In other words,Shinji has transformed
into a statethat is indiscernible
-to the human eye.-MAYA: Yes.
The LCL compositioninside the plug
is in an altered chemical state.
It now closely resemblesseawater
from Earth's antiquity.
MISATO:The primordial soup.
RITSUKO:All of the substancesthat comprise Shinji
are still preservedwithin the plug,
suspended in a quantum state.
For example,his visualization of his ego
has enabled the creationof a facsimile
of his plug suit.
MAYA:Thus, this salvage operation
will involve reconstructinghis physical body
and then embeddinghis psyche within it.
MISATO:You can do something like that?
RITSUKO:With the Magi's support, yes.
MISATO:You mean, theoretically,you could do it?
You never know how thingswill work out
until you give it a shot.
SHINJI:What is this?Where am I?
The Entry Plug?Unit 01's Entry Plug?
But there's no one there.I'm not there.
What is this?What is this?
What is this?I don't understand.
These people...Yes, I know these people.
People who know me.
This is everyonethat makes up my world.
But this... this is supposedto be my world,
but I don't know this.
A projection from outside?
Something that I don't like.
Right, my enemies.
Right, my enemies.
Enemies... enemies...enemies... enemies...
Enemies... enemies...enemies... enemies...
Enemies, named the Angels,
endowed with divine names,and hostile towards us,
our target, NERV's target,Eva's target.
Ms. Misato'starget of vengeance.
So, why do I fight them?
It makes me suffer so much.
Don't be an idiot.
Those weirdunexplainable things
are attacking us.
We need to protect ourselvesfrom stuff like that.
It makes perfect sense.
SHINJI:So, we don't need a reason?
So, I shouldn't think about why?
Enemies, enemies,enemies, enemies.
They're all enemies.
The things that threaten me,us, are enemies.
I'm simply defending myself,keeping yourself alive,
protecting the lives of others.
How could there beanything wrong with that?
Enemy, enemy, enemy, enemy,my enemy, my enemy!
(gasps)
Damn you!Damn you! Damn you!
How could you hurt Tohjiand murder my mother?!
Father!(screaming)
REI:Why do you hate your father?
Why wouldn't I hate him?He's a terrible father.
You don't know your father?
How could I know him?
I mean, he's rarelyever even around me.
Is that the reason you hate him?
SHINJI:That's right.Father doesn't need me.
Father abandoned me.
REI:Am I your substitute?
Yeah, that's it!That's gotta be it!
I was left behindbecause Father had Ayanami!
But you ran out all on your own.
SHINJI:Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
SHINJI:Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
SHINJI:Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
SHINJI:Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
SHINJI:Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
SHINJI:Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
SHINJI:Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
It's all Father's fault!
I actually came hereto tell Father
exactly how much I despised him.
You want me to get insidethis thing
and get scared out of my mind?
-Correct.-No, I don't want to!
After all this time, why now?
You left me becauseI was no use to you, right?
A need arose, so I sent for you.
But why? Why me?
Because this task would beimpossible for others.
It's impossible for me, too.
I've never even heardof this thing until now,
and you want me to fight in it?!
No, that's wrong.I knew.
Yes.
I knew about the Evas.
And on that day,that was the day that I ran away
from Father and Mother!
WOMAN:Currently regulatingthe temperature
of the LCL at 3-6.
Oxygen levels are green.
MAN:EM pulse radiation functionnominal.
Wave pattern is set to running.
FEMALE:All monitoring instrumentationfunction nominal.
MAYA:The salvage operation outline?
You're amazing, as always.
How'd you get it readyin just one month?
Actually, I'm not the onewho came up with it.
It's using data froman experiment ten years ago.
So, this has happened before,during Eva's development?
It happened way beforeany of us came here.
I think my mother was herewhen it happened.
I only know aboutthe data left behind.
What was the resultof the experiment at that time?
I believe that it failed.
SHINJI:So kind.
So warm.
I wonder if this is the warmthof other people.
I never knew.
REI:What is loneliness?
I didn't understand it before,
but I think I actually knowwhat it is now.
REI:What is happiness?
I didn't understand it before,
but I think I actually knowwhat it is now.
Are they kind to you?Other people?
-They are.-Why's that?
Because...because I'm an Eva pilot.
They take care of mebecause I pilot the Eva.
That's the reasonwhy I get to be here.
All the support I getis based on that rationale.
That's why, that's whyI need to pilot the Eva.
-REl: Pilot it, and...?-SHINJI: And fight.
I need to fight the things
that other peoplecall the enemy.
-REI: Fight, and...?-I need to fight and win.
That's right.I can't lose.
I need to follow whatother people tell me to do.
I need to pilot the Evaand win all the fights.
That's the only way.
People will say...people will say...
people will say...
(dial tone, beeping)
-MISATO: Keep it up.-RITSUKO: Keep it up.
ASUKA:Geez, get your acttogether, really.
-TOHJI: Keep at it.-KENSUKE: Keep it up!
GENDOH:Good work, Shinji.
SHINJI:Ms. Misato, Ms. Ritsuko,
Asuka, Tohyi,Kensuke, Father.
They all praise me.
They praise mewhen I pilot the Eva.
They praise me.
They all come to tell meto pilot the Eva.
Father... I'm goingto impress Father,
the father that abandoned me.
MISATO:Keep it up.
SHINJI:I am keeping it up.
I have kept it up.
Someone please be kind to me.
I fought so much.
I've been at this for so long.
Someone,please take care of me.
Please!I need you to be kind!
MISATO:I am being kind to you.
So, Shinji, you wanna be one
with me, don't you?
Be one with mein body and soul.
It's something that feelsreally good.
I'm ready, Shinji,always ready for you.
ASUKA:Come on, idiot Shinji.
You want to be onewith me, don't you?
Be one with mein body and soul?
It's something that feelsreally good.
I'm actually calling outto you, idiot.
Hurry it up!
REI:Shinji, you wantto be one with me?
Be one with mein body and soul?
It's something that feelsreally good.
Shinji...
MISATO:You wanna be one with me.
ASUKA:Be one with mein body and soul.
REI:It's somethingthat feels really good.
MISATO/ASUKA/REI:Come on, don't worry.
Just let your heart go.

(voices speeding up,distorting)
AYANAMI MISATO ASUKARITSUKO TOHJI KENSUKE
-(alarm blaring)-MAYA: Negative!
His ego-boundary has beenlocked into a continuous loop.
Try broadcastingall wave patterns
in every direction.
Damn it, it's not working.
The signals are getting trappedin the Klein space.
So, what does that mean?
It means... we failed.
-(gasps)-Abort intervention.Reverse tangent graph.
-Return additive value to nil.-Ma'am.
Destrudo signatures
in the primitive cortical area.Pattern Sepia.
The core pulseis fluctuating as well!
It's gone to Plus 0.3!
Priority one,maintaining its current state.
-Stop the reverse flow.-Ma'am.
Plus 0.5, 0.8.
It's strange, I can't stop it!
What is this? Why?
Don't you wannacome back, Shinji?
SHINJI:I don't know.
I don't know.
I.. 1...
So, what do you wish for?
-What do you wish for?-What do you wish for?
YUI:What do you wish for?
(alarm blaring)
The Eva refused the signal!
The LCL self-assemblyis currently disintegrating.
Pressure inside the plug rising!
Abort operations.Cut the power.
Negative.The plug has commenced exit.
-No, Shinji-(gasps)
-Where am I?-You're inside the Eva.
Inside the Eva?
I piloted an Eva again?Why?
The Eva is ready.Will you pilot it?
SHINJI:I've decidedI won't pilot an Eva again.
MISATO:But you did get into it,
into Evangelion Unit 01.
-(gasps)-Shinji, you are here right now
because you piloted an Eva.
You became who you are nowby piloting an Eva.
It is a fact.You have piloted an Eva.
You cannot change that.
You, your past--these are the things
you cannot reject.
However, whatever it isthat you will do in the future,
that, you need to decide.
SHINJI:I.. 1...
(Misato sobbing)
What's science?
What's the point of scienceif it can't save one person?!
Give me back Shinji.Give him back!
(wings flapping,birds screeching)
>?
The smell... smell of someone.
Ms. Misato?Ayanami?
No, different.
That's right.
This smellis the smell of my mom.
GENDOH:So, this child must now live
through the aftermathof the Second Impact
in this hell.
YUI:Well, as long as thereis the will to live,
you can turn any placeinto a paradise.
After all, you're alive,
so opportunitiesfor happiness are everywhere.
GENDOH:Yes. Of course.
SHINJI:Ma...
YUI:Have you chosen a name?
GENDOH:If it's a boy, Shinji.
If we have a girl, then Rei.
YUI:Shinji, Rei.
(chuckles)
SHINJI:Mother?
>?
(sobbing)
(liquid sloshing)
Shinji?
RITSUKO:The repair work on Unit 01
will be completethe day after tomorrow.
MISATO:In the end,humans are just creatures
that wind up using the powerof gods as weapons.
RITSUKO:Perhaps.Supposedly, the council
is considering groundingUnit 01.
MISATO:The artificialhuman Evangelion,
created by man with a hugemysterious black box inside.
Well, that's not as importantas the fact
that Shinjiwas returned safe and sound.
RITSUKO:I didn't haveanything to do with that.
I think it was you.
Hey, let's grab a drink.
We haven't done that in a while.
MISATO:Uh, can't.
-I'm a bit busy tonight.-Oh.
-(car door closing)-MISATO: Later.
Running off to her secret lover
now that Shinji's all right.
I suppose I'm not one to talk.
MISATO:I bet Ritsuko is lookingdown on me right now
thinking I'm indecentbeing here with you.
KAJI:Wallowing in carnal desiresis natural.
The deceptionshould hold for a while.
MISATO:For who? NERV intelligence?
Commander Ikari?Ritsuko?
Or for me?
Not them. Yourself.
You don't mean... others?
No, you've never really beeninterested in others,
have you, Kaji?
Yet, you're always lonely,just like my father.
KAJI:So, you still smoke?
MISATO:Only after doingsomething like this.
That makes you the only personto know, Kaji.
KAJI:I'm... honored to hear that.
MISATO:So, this HumanInstrumentality Project,
how far have they gotten?
Adam could destroy us all.
Why is it being protectedunderground?
KAJI:Do you see meto find out about this stuff?
MISATO:Yes, that's part of it,if I'm being honest.
(Kaji chuckles)
I'm honored to be takenadvantage of by you,
but I can't talkabout that here.
MISATO:Right now, I just want youto know what I want.
What's the true purpose of NERVand Commander Ikari?
KAJI:I'd like to know that myself.
(Misato moaning)
MISATO:Hey, don't tryto distract me like that.
It's not...(moaning)
(both moaning)
-(moaning continues)-(sheets rustling)
Hey, what are you tryingto Jam into me?
This isn't the best time.What is it?
KAJI:A present.The first in eight years.
-Hmm?-And it may be my last one.

MAN:Are you talkingabout Dr. Katsuragi's
Super Solenoid theory?
MAN 2:That theory is fartoo radical, I must say.
MAN 3:It's still nothing more thana hypothesis at this stage.
MAN:But there's no other wayto explain how that giant
could be powered adequately...
(overlapping chatter)
MAN 4:Well, it's rightin front of us,
$0 you cannot denyits existence.
KEEL:Scientists havefar too much faith
in their deliberations.
GENDOH:You think they're dogmatic?
KEEL:They're far too obsessive.
These are people who cannotaccurately perceive reality.
GENDOH:Yet these arethe people entrusted
to discover the truth.It's ironic.
KEEL:There's nothing nobleabout that.
Discovery grants them elation
and understandingpaves the way to hegemony.
They seek self-gratification,nothing more.
(crashing, glass shattering)

It's gone past the threshold!
WOMAN:The DNA inserted into Adam

KAJI:One last job to do.
The red is like blood.
EPISODE 21: THE BIRTH OF NERV
What? The Deputy Commanderhas been abducted?
MAN:It happened two hours ago.
He was last confirmedin Ward 8 in the west.
After that, he disappeared.
That's inside our facilities.
You are the IntelligenceDepartment.
-How could you lose him?-An informant,
someone on the insidewho managed to manipulate us.
Put simply, the personin question deceived us.
MISATO: Someone outsmartedIntel Section 2.
-You don't think...-Ryoji Kaji.
We believe he's heavily involvedin this matter.
And that's whyyou came to talk to me.
Thank you for understandingthis situation.
It pains us to admitwe have doubts
in the loyaltyof our operations section chief,
but we do have to do our job.
Considering the historyhe and I have,
this decisionis the logical step to make.
MAN:Thank you for your cooperation.Escort her.
FUYUTSUKI:It's been quite a long time,Chairman Keel.
Bit of a rough welcome though,don't you think?
KEEL:An apology is not required here.
This was a logical step to make
so that I could havea thorough discussion with you.
I see you haven't changed.
My current circumstancesreflect my value.
The subject at handrequires immediate attention.
We had no other choice.
Please understand.
I expected the council,not Seele, to question me.
SEELE 07:We have no intentionto create a new god.
SEELE 09:Please cooperate,Professor Fuyutsuki.
FUYUTSUKI:Professor Fuyutsuki... hmm.
STUDENT: Professor!Professor Fuyutsuki!
STUDENT: Professor!Professor Fuyutsuki!
Hmm?Uh... hello, gentlemen.
Are you busy today, sir?
Want to join us for beersat Kamogawa?
-Beers again?-STUDENT 2: Ryoko and the others
said they'd go,but only if you're there, too.
STUDENT 3:Yeah, and our professor
thinks you should goevery once in a while.
All right.Count me in.
(people chattering)
It's good to get out and havea drink with your peers.
-Right.-You're a brilliant man,
but you hardly make the effort
to cultivate relationshipswith others.
I'm humbled by your concern.
Yeah, by the way, Fuyutsuki,
there's a studentover in bioengineering
who's put togethera fascinating report.
The student's name is Ikari.
Have you ever heardthat name before?
Ikari... I haven't.
Well, this studentwas interested in meeting you
after I mentioned your name.
I have no doubtyou'll be contacted very soon.
Try to be accommodating.
Ikari's the name, right?I'll be on the lookout.
METAPHYSICAL BIO, LAB NO. I FUYUTSUKI
I have read through your paper.
I have doubtsabout two or three points,
but it was a verystimulating read.
Thank youfor the compliment, sir.
Your name was lkari?Yui lkari?
That's right.
What are your plansafter university?
Become an employee elsewhere,
or find a positionat a lab here?
I haven't given too much thoughtto my future.
Besides, there's a third optionI think you might be forgetting.
-Hmm?-I could always choosethe domestic life, you know?
That is, if I can findsomeone suitable.
(computer whirring)
AGAIN, IN 2015 A.D.
Having assimilated the S2 Drive,
Evangelion Unit 01 has attained
an absolute existence.
We've no use for a godthat has manifested itself.
KEEL:Creation of a god is forbidden.
Moreover, we can't allowthis god
to fall into that man's hands.
Gendoh Ikari,can this man be trusted?
Gendoh Rokubungi?
Yes, I've heardthat name before.
AGAIN, IN 1999 A.D.
Well, I don't know himpersonally.
His fame and reputationprecede him.
Kyoto Prefectural Police
What?
Why would he want to bereleased into my custody?
No, I'll go.When should I come?
No, I'll go.When should I come?
I've heard about youfrom a certain individual,
and I've wanted to meet youIn person ever since.
Not very dignified of youto get into a fight
after getting drunk.
GENDOH:Well, the fight was upon me
before I could talk myselfout of it.
I'm not very goodat winning people's affection,
as I'm used to havingdisdain directed at me.
Well, I don't seewhat this has to do with me.
Professor,you're exactly the man
I pictured you would bein my head.
FUYUTSUKI:I wrote him off as beingthe disagreeable type
as my first impression.
This was a time when the country
still had seasons.
I remember it being fall.
Is that really true?
ltis.Mr. Rokubungi and I
have been in a relationshipfor some time.
FUYUTSUKI:I couldn't hide my shock
when I heard those wordscome from her mouth.
To be honest,it's hard to imagine
that you twowould get along well.
Come now, Professor.He can be very cute
once you get to know him better.
It's just that nobodyknows about it.
Then perhapsI would be better off
not knowing as well.
I'm sorry,did I cause you trouble
by introducing him to you?
No, I can seehe's an interesting man,
but I can't bring myselfto like him.
My colleagues thoughthe only became close to Yui
out of his desirefor her talents,
and to have an inwith an organization
she was associated with.
It wasn't until laterthat I heard the rumors
the name of the organizationwas Seele.
2000 A.D., ANTARCTICA
In the last yearof the 20th century,
the great tragedythe Second Impact took place.
Thus, the first yearof the 21st century
could only be describedas hell on earth.
It cannot be describedin any other terms.
2002 A.D.
RUINS OF TOYOHASHI CITY, AICHI PREFECTURE
MAN:They say it'll be30 degrees Celsius again today.
It feels like more than that.
FUYUTSUKI:It's not uncommon here anymore,not in today's Japan.
Summer has lastednearly an entire year.
It's destroying my health.
And why haven't you movedto the ship above yet?
FUYUTSUKI:You mean the neighboring town
where the airis suffocating in engine oil?
It's a bit much for my tastes.
MAN:Fair.
But we never thoughtyou'd start a practice here,
of all places.
It took a long time to find you.
FUYUTSUKI:They're short on doctors here.
I'm an imitation,but it's better than nothing.
A mission to the Antarctic now?
MAN:A U.N. Security Councilinvestigation
regarding the incident.
While this organizationIs provisional,
I think you could serveyour fellow man better
on this mission than playinglocal unlicensed doctor,
Professor Fuyutsuki.
FUYUTSUKI:Former professor, actually.
The space indicatingwho recommended me is blank.
Who was it?
ANTARCTICA, THAT SAME YEAR
FUYUTSUKI:It's hard to imaginean icy continent was once here.
There's no sign of anything.
GENDOH:Professor Fuyutsuki.
You again.I'm amazed you're alive.
I was under the impressionthat you were part
of the expedition teamof the Katsuragi Commission.
Yes, however I was back in Japanon the day of the incident
and luckilyavoided the tragedy.
I see.
Look, Rokubungi, I don't...
Sorry, but I've changedmy name since last time.
A postcard?
You've heardof business cards, right?
Long lime no Sees Hope Joy, are Wey

Doesn't havethe best reputation.
Twisting the armof the Security Council
doesn't seem very prudent.
I see thatyou're as principled as ever.
But no organizationthat plays by the rules
could survive in this age.
This official investigationof the Second Impact, you knew.
It would be suspiciousif the entire investigation team
was comprised of Seele members.
That's why you brought us in,isn't it?
2015 A.D.
NO. 4 QUARANTINE FACILITY, NERV HQ
MISATO:I'm still bad with dark places.
Bad things alwayscome back to me.
FUYUTSUKI:Who is she?
MAN:She's the lone survivor
from the original expedition.
2002 A.D.
Her name is Misato Katsuragi.
FUYUTSUKI:Katsuragi?
FUYUTSUKI:Katsuragi?
As in Dr. Katsuragi's daughter?
Yeah.She hasn't spoken a word
in two years.
That's horrible.
MAN:What she saw,it must have been awful.
Psychological traumacan take much more time to heal
compared to a physical injury.
Agreed.
We must be carefulwhen releasing research results.
A transformed atmosphereperfectly enclosed
in a distinct area.
The complete eradicationof all life-forms,
including microbes.
A vast underground chamber
under the epicenterof the explosion.
And this giant of light.
It seems this incidentis full of mysteries.
Later, the United Nationswould officially report
Second Impact Caused By Massive Meteorite
the Second Impact resulted
Second Impact Caused By Massive Meteorite
from an extraordinarilylarge meteor.
Second Impact Caused By Massive Meteorite
But I could seethrough this lie.
This was a blatant cover-upat work.
I could catch hints of Seele
and a man called Keelat work behind the scenes.
I had to find out the dark truthbehind this incident...
Even if that meant seeing
Yui Ikari's name implicated.
(gasps lightly)
It's been a long time.
Yes, it has been.
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE
FUYUTSUKI:Why did you hidethe existence of the giant?
Did you know?Did you know beforehand
that the Second Impactwould happen on that day?
You mentioned you were luckyto have been off-site
the day before the incident.
Was it also luckwhen you collected
all the research materialbefore leaving?
GENDOH:I'm surprised that any of this
managed to not get incinerated.
FUYUTSUKI: I've also donesome investigating
into your assets.
I'm aware that raising a childIS expensive.
But don't you thinkthe money you have
far exceeds the needsof one person?
Impressive as always, Professor.
You should considera career in economics.
I will make it publichow your group Seele
and the Dead Sea Scrollslurked in the shadows
of the Second Impact.
I have no intentionof forgiving those
behind that calamity.
As you wish.But before you do that,
there's somethingI'd like to show you.
We're going below quite far.
-Does that trouble you somehow?-Somewhat, yes.
What is this?
GENDOH:It's a cavern left behind
by someone who wasn't us.
89% of it is buried.
FUYUTSUKI:So, it was originallyan immaculate
spherical underground cavern?
Is this similarto the underground cavern
that was found in the Antarctic?
GENDOH:They appear to be identical.
Are you intending to repeatthis tragedy once more?
Is that your plan?
GENDOH:That's something you'll haveto decide for yourself.
Humanity is directingall available resources
toward building that facility.
(chimes)
Hmm?
Oh, Professor Fuyutsuki.
FUYUTSUKI:Naoko, you, too?
Yes.This is the best place for me
to pursue my goal in developingfundamental theories
regarding biological computers.
FUYUTSUKI:I see.
NAOKO:I plan to name it the Magi.
FUYUTSUKI:The Magi?
The three wise menfrom the Orient?
Is this whatyou wanted to show me?
NAOKO:No.
That's over here.
I'll be back, Ritsuko.
What is this?
Wait, is this the giant?
NAOKO:We don't say "giant."
We at Gehirn call him Adam.
But this one is different.
This is notthe original Adam.
-This is...-Yes, born of Adam.
-This before you is Eva.-Eva?
Part of our Adamreconstruction effort,
codenamed Project E,and this is the prototype.
We call it Eva Unit 00.
FUYUTSUKI:A prototype of a god.
GENDOH:Fuyutsuki,would you be interested
in creating a new pathfor mankind's history?
2015 A.D.
MAYA:Um, Doctor?
(gasps)Oh, sorry about that.
Let's get startedtesting Rei again.
MAYA:Ms. Katsuragi didn'tshow up today, did she?
RITSUKO:Hmm? No, she didn't.
Ms. Katsuragi?
Yeah, Misato Katsuragi.Nice meeting you.
RITSUKO:Dear Mother,
the other day,I met a girl named Katsuragi.
Most people just look at mefrom afar
and keep their distance.
When that happens, I'm remindedof how well-known you are.
But for some reason,she treats me like anyone else.
She's different.
I learned she wasthe sole survivor
of that expedition team.
She temporarily sufferedfrom speech loss.
She doesn't everstop talking now.
It's like she's making upfor the time she was silent.
NAOKO:Dear Ritsuko,
I've been stuckburied below, as usual.
I can't standthese boxed lunches
they give out anymore.
I understand they starteddevelopment on Tokyo-3
as part of thatsecond capital transfer project.
RITSUKO:Misato disappearedfrom college for a bit.
I made her tell me whereshe was when she came back.
It's pretty stupid.She'd been crashing
at her boyfriend's apartmentfor a week, lounging around.
Never a dull day.
I learned somethingunexpected about her.
She introduced me to him today.
He's cute,but I could never get along
with someone so carefree.
NAOKO:You were never comfortable
around boys, were you, Ritsuko?
Maybe because you only hada mom growing up.
Sorry.
I never took enough timeto be with you.
It's selfish of me to pretendlike I'm a good mother.
Oh, motherhood.
2003 A.D.
HAKONE, LAKE ASHI LEVEE
FUYUTSUKI: This weatherwill never change.
Japan will neversee autumn again.
It's a pity.
According to the scenario
set out in Seele'shidden Dead Sea Scrolls,
the Third Impact will occurten years from now.
YUI: Organizationslike Seele and Gehirn
exist solely to prevent thatfrom happening.
I agree with you, mind you.Just not Seele.
Professor Fuyutsuki,breaking that seal
could mean a cataclysmto this world.
Ikari has allmy research material.
There's only so muchone person can do.
But I won't dowhat I did before.
(baby cooing)
(baby babbling)
And they've been warning mewith subtle threats.
They've made it clearthey could rub me out
in the blink of an eye.
It seems they're uncomfortable
with the amountof information I have.
The rest of us survivorsas well.
Fact is, it's a simple thingto destroy people.
That's not a reasonto be their test subject, Yui.
I will ride alongwith the currents.
That's why I'm with Seele.
But also, I do this for him.For Shinji.
2004 A.D.
HAKONE, UNDERGROUND TESTING FACILITY NO. 2
-(giggling)-MAN: LCL pressure, plus 0.2.
MAN 2:No Destruda signatureis detected in transmitter.
FUYUTSUKI:Why is that child here?
That's Director Ikari's son,Sir.
Ikari, this isn'ta daycare center.
Today is very important.
YUI:Sorry, Professor Fuyutsuki.
I brought him with me.
But why, Yui?
You knew that your experimentwas today.
YUI:That's why he's here.
I want him to seethat there's a bright future
ahead of him.
NAOKO:Those were Ms. Yui'slast words.
A freak accident that day
made her disappearfrom this world,
exactly like I had wished for.
(sighing)I'm a terrible woman.
Ritsuko, after that day,
Director Ikariwas a changed man.
FUYUTSUKI: Where have you beenfor an entire week?
I understandyou must be heartbroken,
but you havenumerous responsibilities
that far exceedyour immediate needs.
GENDOH:I'm aware, Fuyutsuki.
Today, I will proposeto advance a new plan.
I've already submitted itto Chairman Keel.
You can't be thinking...
I am, the paththat leads to divinity,
something no onehas successfully realized,
the Human InstrumentalityProject.
2008 A.D.
RITSUKO:Dear Mother,congratulations
on completing the fundamentaltheories for the Magi.
I didn't mean this to bea gesture of congratulation,
but I've been informally hiredto join Gehirn.
I'll be assigned to workas part of Project E.
(footsteps approaching)
MAN:Who's there?
Ritsuko Akagi of the TechnologyDevelopment Department.
My I.D.
I heard the main structuresof the command center
were complete, so I came.
This place is a maze.
MAN:The director and Dr. Akagi
are at the command centerright now.
NAOKO:You're sure about this?
GENDOH:Yes.
I have no regrets in work.
NAOKO:Liar.
You still can't let go of Yui.
But even so, I don't care.
2010 A.D.
GEO-FRONT ARTIFICIAL CANOPY
VENTRAL POINT DEFENSE EMPLACEMENT NO. 2 (PLANNED SITE)
GENDOH:And that is Gehirn HQ.
Good morning, Director.
Oh, you brought your son today.
A girl?
Wait, I thought you hada little boy.
Yes, but this isn't Shinji.
An acquaintance of mine asked meto look after this child.
Her name is Rei Ayanami.
Hi there, Rei,it's nice to meet you.
NAOKO:This child reminds me of...
Yui?
All files pertainingto Rei Ayanami
have been deleted.
It's a blank slate.What's going on?
MAGI SUPER COMPUTER SYSTEM COMPLETED
Magus Casper, Magus Balthasar,
and Magus Melchior.
Three sides of meare in the Magi--
myself as a scientist,myself as a mother,
and myself as a woman.
Those three identitiesstruggle with each other.
So, three of you, huh, Mother?
All that's leftis to power it on.
Well, I'm gonna head home early.
Misato is dueto come back today.
Oh, I forgot.
She works for Gehirn now,doesn't she?
-She's in Germany, right?-That's right.
She works at the Third Branch.
Then she's ina long-distance relationship.
I heard that they broke up.
Oh, no.That's too bad.
They looked likethe perfect couple.
You never knowhow relationships work out.
Men and women aren't logical.
Still searching for patterns.You never change, do you?
A cold analyst like yourisks losing out on happiness.
The definition of happinessis even more nebulous.
All right, it's been too longsince I've gone out for a drink.
-Good work today, dear.-Thanks, you, too.
(footsteps fading)
-(door opens)-(sighs)
(door closes)
Huh?
Yes, what can I do for you, Rei?
I got lost exploring.
Oh, I see.
Well, then would you liketo walk back with me?
Nuh-uh.
But you won't be ableto get back on your own.
It's none of your business,old hag.
-Excuse me?-I can make it back
without any help from you,an old hag.
Calling someone an old hagis very rude, you know.
But you are an old hag.
Very well, then.
I'll have to getDirector Ikari to scold you.
But those are his words.
It's what the directorcalls you.
-(gasps)-"That old hagis an incessant bother.
-That old hagis no longer useful."-(gasps)
(echoing):"That old hagis no longer useful.
"That old hag is no longeruseful.
That old hagis an incessant bother."
It's what the directorcalls you.
"That old hagis no longer useful...
...Incessant bother."
(Rei choking)
You're nothing.
There are plentyof replacements for you, Rei.
You're just like me.
(gasps)
(whimpering)
FUYUTSUKI:On that day, the HumanInstrumentality Project
headed by Chairman Keel Lorenz,
dissolved Gehirn,its research organization.
Special agency NERVwas established
to finishcarrying out the project.
Every one of us transferredto become members of NERV,
with the one exceptionbeing Dr. Akagi,
the key figurein the development
of the Magi system.
2015 A.D.
(beeping)
Right. Time to go.
-It's you.-Been a while, sir.
I had the guard outsideget some shuteye.
This act of yours will onlyfurther endanger your life.
I'm doing this to getcloser to the truth.
The truth inside me.
Besides, I think they caught on
that I provided Commander Ikariwith a sample of Adam.
So, I'm partiallydoing this for myself
before things get really nasty.
MAN:Thank you for your cooperation.
-I'm free to go?-Correct.
The issue at handhas now been resolved.
I see.
-And him?-I do not know, ma'am.
(footsteps fading)
(door closes)
Hey.What took you so long?
(gunshot)
(door closing)
MISATO:I'm home.
(distant siren wailing)
"
(gasps)
RC
(beeps)
KAJI:Katsuragi, it's me.
By the time you getthis message,
I've probably made lifea lot harder for you.
For that, I'm sorry.
Give my apologiesto Ritsuko as well.
I know I don't have the rightto ask for favors,
but there are some flowersI'd like you to look after.
If you could water themin my place, that'd be great.
-Shinji knows where they're at.-(whimpering)
Katsuragi...the truth is with you.
Keep going.Don't look back.
If... if I can see you again,
I'll say the wordsI meant to say eight years ago.
Bye.
AUTOMATED VOICE:12 o'clock, two minutes, P.M.
(Misato sobbing)
You idiot.
You're an idiot... Kaji.
(sobbing)
(sobbing continues)
SHINJI:The only thing I could do
was run away from Ms. Misato.
There was nothing I could do.Nothing I could say.
I was just a child.
TO BE CONTINUED

NEXT EPISODE
Asuka is in a mentaldownward spiral
after being one-upped by Shinji.
Wasted energyin the form of impatience
only results in exhaustionand frustration.
And then, a mental attackunleashed by an Angel
delivers the final blowto her heart.
Asuka loses her only meansof bouncing back.
The harshness of realitywears down everyone's hearts
to shattered pieces.
Shinji has no wordswith which to console her.
Next episode,"Staying Human."
STAYING HUMAN


________________


ASUKA:Hmm... tomorrow,I'll be in Japan.
Misato said she'd be hereby noon.
Oh, Misato was the onein Germany before you, Mr. Kaji.
I don't like her, though.
She seems so fakeall the time.
Shucks, I'm not gonna be ableto see you anymore.
That sucks big time.(whines)
I'm sure there'll bea long line of guys
begging to be your boyfriendwhen you get to Japan.
I heard the Third Childrenis a boy.
Why don't you trygetting along with him?
Ah!
I'm not interestedin some dumb little kids.
-(can rattling)-The only one for meis you, Mr. Kaji.
I'm honored. I truly am.
Come on, Mr. Kaji, I'm serious!
I'd say yes a million timesif you'd just ask me.
Ask me to kiss youand do other things, too!
Asuka, you're still a kid.
You should waituntil you've grown up
before you getinto that stuff.
What? But why?
I've grown up more than enoughto be with you.
I'm an adult!An adult! An adult!
I'm an adult!
Look at me!Please!
(bell tolling)
MAN:The hypotheticalhas become a reality.
It's ironic that the personwho advocated for it
would become the test subject.
MAN 2:So, the contact experiment
was directly responsiblefor this?
MAN:A total mental breakdown
was the result of their contact.
MAN 2:It's cruel.To leave behind
a young daughterby committing suicide.
MAN:Well, there are other factors
that might be at play.
KYOKO:Asuka, sweetie,Mommy made your favorite dish
in the world today,isn't that nice?
Come on, eat.Don't be picky.
What will the older girlover there think of you?
FEMALE DOCTOR:Her condition hasn't changed.
She keeps talking to that dollthinking it's her daughter.
MR. LANGLEY:Maybe it's a reflectionof her guilt.
She was so absorbedinto her research,
she made little timefor her daughter.
FEMALE DOCTOR:That must be so horriblefor you, Mr. Langley.
MR. LANGLEY:It's eerie.
They look like a setof matching dolls,
mother and daughter.
But if you think about it,maybe there isn't much
separating humans from dolls.
FEMALE DOCTOR:But dolls are, after all,made by people.
People craft theminto their own image.
If a god exists,
perhaps we were madein his image.
MR. LANGLEY:That was quite unexpected
coming from a practitionerof modern medicine.
FEMALE DOCTOR:(laughs) I may be a doctor,but I'm still a person.
A woman, in fact.
(fabric rustling)
(woman moaning lightly)
You're so brave, Asuka.
It's okay to cry, dear.
I don't need to.I won't cry.
I'll be fine,I'll think for myself.
RITSUKO:Asuka, can you hear me?
Your sync rateis down by eight.
You have to purge your mindof distracting thoughts.
I am trying to!
EPISODE 22: STAYING HUMAN
MAYA:Asuka's synchronization rate,
it keeps dropping even further.
RITSUKO:This is only compounding withall the other problems we have.
We'll have to give priorityto repairing Rei's Unit 00.
Right now, we don't havethe resources
to repair both simultaneously.
WOMAN:The mitosis processon left arm of Unit 02
has met targeted values.
MAN:Necrosis is currentlybelow 0.05%.
WOMAN 2:Apoptosis progressingwith no problems.
WOMAN 3:Unit 00's morphogenesis system
shall maintain current status.
WOMAN 4:Please connectthe Number 2 signal
to each receptor.
MISATO:The Eva series,
all born of Adam.
We can't defeat the Angelswithout using the very thing
that caused the Second Impact.
In their desperation,man is willing to work
with the scourge that threatenedtheir very existence.
That's humanity for you.
Deep down, maybe I really dohate the Evas.
They killed my father.
MAKOTO:Ms. Katsuragi!
MISATO:They've started constructionof Eva units through number 13
in seven locationsaround the world?
MAKOTO: Yes, ma'am.This info comes from
a reliable source in Shanghai.
MISATO: Why are they in a rushto mass-produce them?
MAKOTO:Well, two Evas have been lost,
and two more needmassive repairs.
Maybe they're in a rushto reinforce the reserve forces
as part of the Phase Twobuild-up.
MISATO:I've thought that might be it.
We've had to resortto cannibalizing parts
from Unit 05 and 06 thatwere being built in Germany,
and there does seem to bea lot more money flowing, too.
MAKOTO: At this stage,they've doubled our budget.
I wonder if that meansthe people on top
are getting desperate.
MISATO: It's clear the councilare getting anxious
about something.
MAKOTO: Do you thinkthey could be expecting
these singleindividual attacks
could turn into multipleAngel attacks at the same time?
MISATO: It's plausible,but that doesn't explain
why they'd keep thisunder wraps.
So there has to besomething else going on.
OPERATOR:We're sorry,you have reached a number
that has been disconnectedor is no longer in service.
Please check the numberyou dialed.
How strange.
My calls aren't evengetting through.
I wonder if he hadto head out somewhere again.
-(beep)-WOMAN (over P.A.):The train is approaching
on Platform Two.
-For your safety, please standbehind the white line...-(gasps)
...while waitingfor the train.
You were absorbed in the Evafor an entire month
until just recently.
Now look.Those two are back together
like nothing ever happened.
Sure, you beat me.
How?
(train whistle blowing)
(music playing faintly,Pen-Pen whimpering)
(Pen-Pen groaning)
MISATO:We're finally back together.
It's too badit has to feel so awkward.
(chopsticks slam down)
Well, thank you for dinner.
(phone ringing)
-Asuka...-I don't think so.
I bet it's Mr. Kajitrying to get ahold of you.
Get it yourself, Misato.
-That won't happen.-(ringing continues)
My, it looks like I've managed
to troublethe invincible Mr. Shinji.
Imagine himhelping the commoners.
Yes, hello?
Who's he trying to impress,acting all composed?
-Hmm?-It's an international call
from Germany, Asuka.It's your mother.
It's for me? My mother?
Give me that!
Hallo, Mutter!
(speaking in German)
SHINJI:Hearing Asuka talkin a foreign language
makes her seemlike a total stranger.
(continues speaking in German)
Her mother, huh?
(dog barking)
(Asuka speaking in German)
Tschiiss, Mutter.Gute nacht.
(beep)
Wow, you were talking to herfor quite a while.
No, just some mundanefamily conversation.
But still,I wish I had that.
It's really not that special.
Besides, it's allsuperficial.
You know,she's not my real mother.
-Huh?-But it's not thatI don't like her
or anything like that.
It's just a little weirdsometimes.
Hmm? Wait a sec!
Why the hell am I talking to youabout all this stuff?!
-I'm sorry.- (scoffs)
I must be turninginto a disaster
if even idiot Shinjistarts to pity me.
(water draining)
Disgusting.
I'm not going in the waterMisato and idiot Shinji
used to bathe themselves in.
I'm not going to usethe washing machine
that Misatoand idiot Shinji used
to wash their underwear.
I'm not gonna use a toilet
that Misatoand idiot Shinji used.
They sat on it before me.
I am not going to breathethe same air
Misato and idiot Shinjiwere breathing.
I hate Misato.I hate Shinji.
And I hatethe First even more!
I hate my dad!I hate my mom!
The one I hate most is me!
I can't take it anymore!I've had it with this!
Why do I haveto put up with this?!
Why?!
(beeping)
MAYA:I'm reading a dropof 12.8 on the sync graph.
It's barely enoughfor activation.
Well, this is dreadful.
It's fallen furtherthan it was yesterday.
Asuka's on the second dayof her period.
Is that why it's so low?
RITSUKO:Sync rates are not dependent
on superficialphysiological states.
Problem is deeper,in her subconscious.
I guess there's no choicebut to change Unit 02's core.
Asuka, you can come up now.
WOMAN (over P.A.):Restoration work onthe Number Eight power system
is scheduled to resume...
RITSUKO:Asuka's pride is in shambles.
MISATO:How could she notlose her confidence
after a defeat like that?
But I think it was losingto Shinji
that made this significant.
All three of usliving together
may not be for the best anymore.
Has everything gone critical?
Did you finally get your fillof playing house?
I don't need someonewho substitutes cats
for humans as companionsto give me lip.
Sorry.I'm on edge, I guess.
This sucks.Why am I stuck with this crap
just because I was borna woman?
And I absolutelydon't want children anyway.
(elevator whirring)
(dings)
(gasps lightly, groans)
(elevator continues whirring)
(sniffles)
An Eva won't do anything unlessyou open your heart to it.
Are you accusing meof putting up walls inside?
Is that what you're saying?
Yes.Each Eva has a heart.
That doll has a heart?
-You know this deep down.-Ha!
If you're trying to starta conversation with me,
hell must have frozen over.
What is it?Does it make you happy
that I can't pilotmy Eva anymore?
What's there to beworried about anyway?
The invincible Shinjiwill save us
when an Angel attacks.Just leave it to him,
'cause he'll take careof everything!
Shinji is the only onethat needs to be here!
Unbelievable.First, Shinji treats me
like a wounded dog,and now the clockwork doll
thinks she can dothe same thing.
I really must havelost my edge.
REI:I'm not a doll.
Shut up!
All you ever dois follow orders.
I bet you'd kill yourself
if Commander Ikariordered you to.
-I would.-(groans)
(smack)
(elevator dings)
You are a doll!
From the very momentI first met you,
I've hated you for actinglike a puppet!
(gasps)I hate you!
I hate all of you!
(elevator whirring)
(grunting)
KENSUKE:Shinji's absent again.
So is Ayanami,but that's not surprising.
Asuka's missing, too.
And Suzuhara's still inthe hospital as well.
School's just notimportant anymore.
Must be bad.
MAN:Eva Unit 02's signalsare nominal.
WOMAN:VA attachmentand fusion status green.
Growth is withinpredetermined limits.
ASUKA:It took long enough,but you're finally back.
How dare you lose like that?
Don't forget,you're my doll,
so you have to followmy orders.
Just do everythingexactly how I tell you to do it,
and don't complain.
Why does a weapon have to havea mind of its own, anyway?
It just ends upgetting in the way.
If you obey my command,everything will go
perfectly well.You'll see.
Hmm?
This is so dumb.
(alarm blaring)
SHIGERU:All personnel,battle stations, Condition One.
Ready anti-air engagement.
Again?Another Angel?
SHIGERU:Visual confirmation of an Angel.
Displayingmaximum magnification.
It seems intent on stayingin satellite orbit.
The Angel is maintaininga fixed distance from us.
Is it waiting for an opportunityto leave orbit
and descend right on top of us?
Or maybe it's able to destroy usfrom its current position.
Could be either, it's difficultto make that call.
In any case,we don't have many options
until the target entersour effective attack range.
An Eva cannot intercept a target
that's in satellite orbit.
How's Rei?
Rei and Unit 00 status,all green.
Roger.Launch Unit 00.
Prep for extremelong-distance sniping.
Unit 02 and Asuka
will stand by for launchas backup support.
Me, support Unit 00?Are you serious?
MISATO:That's right.Give her cover from the rear.
What kind of a joke is this?
Eva Unit 02,now launching.
Asuka!
Let her go.
She can take pointif she wants to.
But Major Katsuragi!
I supposeif she fails today,
then that's the endfor Asuka.
This is her last chance,isn't it?
Let's start thinkingof a new pilot
-to replace Unit 02's.-Roger.
But ma'am, why aren't wedeploying Eva Unit 01?
MISATO:It's been groundedby strict orders
from Commander Ikari.
It's no surpriseafter what happened before.
Negy "ree, LS
(alarm blaring)
If I fail this time,
I'm sure they'll take meoff Unit 02.
You can't failthis mission, Asuka.
SHIGERU:Target is still outsideof effective range.
Damn!Hurry up and get over here.
This is driving meup the damn wall.
(gasps)
» Hallelujah »
(alarm blaring)
MISATO:Is that the enemy'senergy weapon?
SHIGERU:It's devoidof heat energy properties.
Unit 02's psychological graphis chaotic.
Psychological contaminationhas begun.
Psychological warfare?Impossible.
The Angel knowswhat's in the human heart?
(alarm blaring)
(screaming)Damn you!
(Handel's "Messiah"continues playing)
WOMAN:Positron projectile dissipating.
SHIGERU:It's no use, it's out of range!
(screaming)
(Handel's "Messiah" continues)
(gun clicking)
Unit 02 has expendedall its rounds.
Analysis of that beam.
Its energy wavesare within the visible range.
It's similar to an A.T. Field,but the specifics are unclear.
-Asuka sit-rep.-Psychological contamination
has entered into the Y.
(Handel's "Messiah" continues)
No! Ah!
Stop it! Stay out!
Don't come after me!
(shrieks)
(Handel's "Messiah" continues)
(gasps)
(gasps)
(shouts)
Stop it!
Stop looking into my heart.
Please, don't violatemy heart!
-Stop it!-Asuka!
MAYA:Psychograph reading's at limit.
The mental circuitsare being torn completely apart.
It's too dangerousto take on any more stress.
Get back!
No!
MISATO:That's a direct order.
-Withdraw!-No, absolutely not!
I'd rather die right herethan pull back now.
Asuka...
MAN:Acceleratorsynchronization start!
WOMAN:Voltage increasing.Charge density achieved.
MAN 2:Forced convergencedevice active.
WOMAN 2:Adjusting for rotationin red, plus 0.0003.
MAN 3:Super-conductorinduction system online.
MAN 4:Chamber interior pressureat maximum.
MAKOTO:Disable final safety device.
WOMAN:Safety disengaged.
MAKOTO:Systems ready for fire.
Negative.We're going to need
far more energy than thisto penetrate the A.T. Field
at these distances.
We're already at maximum power.
We can't put any more energyinto it.
MAYA:Psychological graph signalis very weak.
What about the LCLpsychological firewall?
It's not working.The catalyst has no effect.
Priority one, life support.
-Prevent flow reversalfrom the Eva.-Roger.
It's as if Asuka'smental wavelengths
are being probedby the light.
Is it possiblethe Angel's trying
to understand the human mind?
(explosion)
(Asuka sobbing)
ASUKA:Why am I crying?
I told myselfI wouldn't cry anymore.
(fabric tearing)
MR. LANGLEY:Asuka, what's wrong?
You didn't likeyour present?
It's from your new mom.
YOUNG ASUKA:I don't want it!
MR. LANGLEY:Well, then, what do you want?
ASUKA:I'm not a child.
I'm gonna grow up fast.
I don't have any usefor stuffed animals in my life.
YOUNG ASUKA:Please look at me, Mommy!
Don't stop being my mommy!Please!
KYOKO:Die with me, Asuka.
YOUNG ASUKA:Mommy! Mommy!
Don't kill me!Don't kill me, please!
No, I'm not your doll, Mommy!
I'm gonna thinkand live only for myself.
I don't need Mommy or Daddy.
-I can live on my own.-Stop!
Stop making meremember all that!
I finally forgot about it.Don't dig it back up.
I don't need thosepainful things anymore.
Please, stop!Please, just stop!
Stop it!
KYOKO:Please, Asuka, sweetie.
Please, die with me.
YOUNG ASUKA:Okay, I'll die with you, Mommy.
Just please don't stopbeing my mommy.
Please, Mommy.
DOLL:Mommy?Never heard of her.
Who are you?
I'm Asuka Langley Soryu.Nice to meet you.
Are you an idiot?
My chance.
I'm an adult,so look at me!
No! This isn't me!It's not me!
I'm Asuka Langley Soryu.Nice to meet you.
Are you an idiot?
My chance.
So, look at me, please!
No! This isn't me!It's not me!
I'm Asuka Langley Soryu.Nice to meet you.
Are you an idiot?
My chance.
I'm an adult,so look at me!
No! This isn't me!It's not me!
I'm Asuka Langley Soryu.Nice to meet you.
Are you an idiot?
My chance.
I'm an adult,so look at me!
No! This isn't me!It's not me!
(echoing):I'm Asuka Langley Soryu.Nice to meet you.
Are you an idiot?
My chance.
I'm an adult,so look at me!
No! This isn't me!It's not me!
(horn blowing)
-Huh?-(echoing giggling)
(gasping, grunting)
(echoing laughter continues)
Ah! Help me!Help me, Mr. Kaji!
KAJI:Asuka, you're still a kid.
(gasps)
What the hellare you doing here?
You won't help me!You won't hold me!
You won't do anything for me!
No one! No one! No one!
So, please look at me!
(phone ringing)
Are you lonely?
Are you lonely?
No!
Get away from me!
I'm gonna live on my own!
So, do you like me?
I won't depend on anyone!
Do you really like me?
I can liveall by myself!
I know you're lying.
(Asuka screaming)
(Asuka screaming)
(Asuka screaming)
(crashing)
(crashing)

(crashing)
ASUKA:My mind... my heart...
it's been defiled.
(sobbing)
Mr. Kaji, what do I do?
I've been soiled.
I'm dirty now.
(Handel's "Messiah" playing)
(Eva powering down)
WOMAN:Unit 02 has ceased operation.
Life supportrecording abnormalities.
MAYA:Pilot is enteringthe danger zone.
Target status unchanged.
Maintaining currentrelative distance.
The chances of the targetchanging position
and enteringUnit 00's firing range is 0.0%.
Maybe we could airlift Unit 00
and snipe the targetin the air.
No, that won't work.If the target shoots
during our approach,we're done for.
-SHINJI: I'll go in Unit 01.-Huh?
Negative.This target has the ability
to infiltrate the mindsof Eva pilots.
GENDOH:We must avoid any situation
where Unit 01 becomes corrupted.
I just need to make sureI don't get hit, right?
That may not be enough.
But we can't leave Asukalike she is now.
So be it.
Rei, go below to the Dogmafor the Spear.
The Spear of Longinus?Ikari, you can't.
It's the only means availableto defeat a target
that's in satellite orbitand out of A.T. Field range.
-Hurry.-But sir,
by allowing Adam and Evato contact one another,
you risk triggeringthe Third Impact.
This is way too dangerous.
Please, Commander Ikari,don't do it.
So, it was a lie.
The Second Impact wasn't caused
by contact with an Angel.
WOMAN:Opening Number Ten to 15at the Central Dogma.
Unit 00 has passedMalebolge Number Six.
Now opening Number 16 to 20.
MISATO:If this isn't enough
to set off the Third Impact,
then what was the causeof the Second Impact?
(Handel's "Messiah" continues)
Ikari, you don't thinkit is too early for this?
The council has begunmass production
of the Eva series.
This is our chance, Fuyutsuki.
But still, Ikari...
One cannot turn back the clock,
but one can move it forward.
You know the old menwon't stand for this.
GENDOH:We must complete this
before Seele sets thingsin motion.
It'd be unwise to lose Unit 02.
Not yet.
FUYUTSUKI:But using the Spear of Longinus
without Seele's permissionwill cause serious trouble.
GENDOH:All we need is a reason.
Anything more is meaningless.
Reason?
You're just lookingfor a good excuse, that's all.
MAKOTO:Pilot's brainwaveshave decreased to 0.06.
MAYA:Life support critical.
SHIGERU:Unit 00 has passed Number Two.
Surfacing now.
-(alarm buzzing)-(Handel's "Messiah" continues)
That's the Spear of Longinus.
SHIGERU:Unit 00 is readyto throw the Spear.
MAKOTO:Target confirmed.Adjustments complete.
MAYA:Countdown commencing.
Ten seconds...
eight, seven, six,
five, four, three,
two, one, zero.
(Handel's "Messiah" continues)
SHIGERU:Target destroyed.
MAYA:Eva Unit 02 has been freed.
And what happened to the Spear?
It has exceededfirst cosmic velocity
and it is currently movinginto lunar orbit.
Recovery would bevirtually impossible.
Yes, we currently have no meansof recovering an object
with a mass of that size.
MAYA:Unit 02 is in good condition.Graph is nominal.
SHIGERU:Recovery, Unit 02to Cage Number Two.
WOMAN:Please employRoute 67 for recovery.
MISATO:How's Asuka?
MAKOTO:Pilot survival confirmed.
Segregated quarantine measures
in response to the contaminationhave been lifted.
I see.
SHINJI:Uh...
I'm glad you're okay, Asuka.
Screw you! I'm not okay!
Of all the people,that woman had to be the one
that saved me.
Having someone like hersave me...
I wish I had just diedthan been saved by her.
I hate it! I hate it!
I hate all of you!I hate all of you to death!

KAJI:Katsuragi, it's me.
By the time you getthis message,
I've probably made lifea lot harder for you.
For that, I'm sorry.
Give my apologiesto Ritsuko as well.
I know I don't have the rightto ask for favors,
but there are some flowersI'd like you to look after.
If you could water themin my place, that'd be great.
Shinji knows where they're at.
Katsuragi,the truth is with you.
Keep going.Don't look back.
If... if I can see you again,
I'll say the wordsI meant to say eight years ago.
Bye.
(answering machine rewinding)
MISATO:A phone that doesn't ring, huh?
Busy working.I'm sorry but please let me be.
(Pen-Pen cooing)
SHINJI:Ms. Misato'sshut in today as well.
NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRYYOU COME IN, YOU DIE!(Pen-Pen cooing)
NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRYYOU COME IN, YOU DIE!
I wonder if Asukawill come home today.
(video game sound effectsand music playing)
HIKARI:She won't go to school.
She won't go home.
She just plays video games.
- Hikari?- What is it?
Let's sleep.
'Kay.
(TV turns off)
(distant siren)
ASUKA:I'm sorry if I'm a nuisance.
No, you're nota nuisance at all.
ASUKA:I couldn't win...fighting in my Eva.
I'm not worth anything anymore,to anyone.
I hate it.I hate it all.
I hate everyone.
But the oneI hate the most is me.
Now I feel likeI just don't care anymore.
Asuka, I think you should dowhatever it is you want to do.
I would never judge you.
I think you did a great job.
(Asuka crying)
(whirring and clanking)
RITSUKO:I see.
Just slipped awayall of a sudden.
Mm, probably.I mean, cats don't live forever.
Please don't cry, Grandma.
Yes, I'll come visitwhen I find some time.
I haven't visited Mom's gravein three years.
I'll make sureto call you when I do.
Okay.Got to go.
(beep)
So, I guess the cat is dead.
EPISODE 23: TEARS
SEELE 03:The Spear of Longinus.
There's no waywe can recover it now.
SEELE 07:Why did you use it?
SEELE 09:You realize we haven't completed
our planned series of Evas yet.
GENDOH:I prioritizedannihilating the Angel.
It was unavoidable.
SEELE 11:Unavoidable?
You should tryto make your excuses
sound more convincing.
SEELE 03:Your recent actsof insubordination
- have been egregious.- (phone ringing)
Fuyutsuki, we are deliberating.
I see.
An Angel is approaching.We will finish this later.
SEELE 06:Assuming you are stillin command afterwards, Ikari.
KEEL:Ikari, do you intendto betray Seele?
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Send Unit 00from Number 32 to the surface.
Unit 02 will provide backup.
Correct, Commander Ikariis the one
with final sayover Unit 01.
I don't have any authority.
Over and out.
Confirm the Angelwith my own eyes. Great.
WOMAN:Unit 00 has been launched.
Deploying to interceptposition.
Unit 02, stand byat current position.
GENDOH:No. Launch.
- But, sir!- Proceed.
She can still be usefulas a decoy.
Yes, sir.
MAN:Eva Unit 02, prepare for launch.
Here I am,shamelessly on board.
I guess I really don't knowwhen to give up, do I?
WOMAN:Moving Unit 02 to Gate Eight.
Launching followingdispatch point designation.
Oh, I wonderif I'll just be a burden
on the othersby being deployed.
MAN:Target has breached the Goraabsolute defense line.
I just don't care, really.Screw it.
MAN:Target is airborneabove Owakudani.
Continuingfixed point rotation.
MAKOTO:Target's A.T. Field is active.
What were you doing?
No time for excuses.Sitrep now!
We are currently deadlockedin a stalemate, ma'am.
Pattern changingfrom Blue to Orange.
It's alternatingat regular intervals.
- What does that mean?- The Magi is saying
it cannot provide an answer.
There's not enough datafor it to formulate an answer.
I'm convincedthat its current state
is only temporary.
MISATO:I suppose we shouldn't makethe first move then.
Rei, we're gonnahold position for now.
No, it's coming.
Rei, fire back at it!
It's too late!She won't be able to!
The target has madephysical contact with Unit 00.
What about Unit 00'sA.T. Field?
It's deployed, but it's beingcorroded by the Angel.
Wait, is that Angelaggressively attempting
to make first contactwith Unit 00?
(Rei grunting)
MAYA:This is bad.
Unit 00's biological componentsare being corrupted.
Launch Eva Unit 02 now.
Have her rescue Reiand provide cover.
MAYA:Corruption by target continuing.
This is dangerous.
Over five percent of Unit 00has fused with the Angel.
MISATO:Asuka, close in at 300
and fire your pallet gunat the target's back
while deploying your A.T. Fieldat maximum power.
Got that?Eva Unit 02, lift off!
Go ahead and lift off, come on.
Asuka, what's wrong?
- Sitrep!- It's useless.
Her Sync rate isin the single digits.
Asuka!
(grunting)It won't move.
It won't move.
She is just a sitting ducklike that.
Get her down right now.
(labored breathing)
REI:Who is it? Me?
The me inside the Eva?
No, I sense somebody hereother than myself.
Who are you?
An Angel?
The person we refer toas an Angel?
Don't you wantto become one with me?
No.I am me.
I am not you.
I see.But it's too late.
It's already begun.
I'll share my heartwith you.
I'll sharewhat I feel with you.
It hurts right there.
Doesn't your heart ache?
Ache?No, this is not pain.
You're lonely.
You feel loneliness.
Loneliness?I don't understand.
You don't want to be alone.
There are so many of us,but you are alone
and you hate it.
That's what lonelinessfeels like.
But that's your heartyou're feeling.
It's yoursthat is full of sadness.
You're feeling it.
(gasps)
These are tears.
I'm the one crying.
- Rei!- Effective immediately,
Eva Unit 01 is to returnto duty.
- Launch Unit 01 now.- What?
Launch Unit 01.
Yes, sir.
It's not fair.
They didn't send out Unit 01when I was in trouble.
(alarm blaring)
MISATO:Deploy A.T. Field.Rescue Rei on the double.
Ma'am.
Shinji!
(gasps)
(distorted echoing laughter)
Shinji, attack it withthe prog knife right now!
(Rei/Angel screaming)
REI:It hurts.You're hurting me, Shinji.
(giggling)
Is this what's inside my heart?
I want to be one with Shinji?
(giggling)
No.
MAYA:Her A.T. Field is inverting.
The corrosionis spreading rapidly.
Is she trying to containthe Angel?
(shrieks)
MAYA:The field is maxing out.
It won't be able to maintainits core much longer.
Rei, abandon the Eva!Eject!
I can't do that,because if I'm gone,
then the A.T. Fieldwill disappear.
That's why I can't.
Rei, are you...
The core is collapsing.It's gone critical!
(gasps)
(whimpering)
(gasping)
SHIGERU:The target is gone.
MISATO:As of this moment,the operation has ended.
Shift to Alert Condition One.
MAKOTO:Roger that.
Stand downto Condition Yellow immediately.
- MISATO: And Unit 00?- MAYA: There are no signs
of entry plug ejection, ma'am.
MISATO:Start the rescue operation.Hurry.
RITSUKO:If there are survivors.
(distant sirens)
MAN:So far, we found no signsof any components
from the 16th Angel.
We are still continuingto search.

(music playingthrough headphones)
MISATO:Shinji? I'm coming in.
(music continues)
Ms. Misato.
No tears will come out.
I feel so sad, but the tears,
they just... they won't come.
Shinji... I wishthere was more I could do.
But all I can do is this.
SHINJI:Stop it!
Please don't, Ms. Misato.
MISATO:I'm sorry.
(footfalls departing)
MISATO:I know he's feeling lonely.
I wonder if he's afraidof women.
No.
He's afraid of getting closeto others.
(TV playing)
Pen-Pen, come here.
(Pen-Pen cooing)
I see.
Anyone would do.I'm the one who's lonely.
Rei, she was alwaysthe product of my despair.
However, she still remainsthe vessel of hope for you.
In the end, I supposeforgetting her is impossible.
(phone ringing)

MISATO:Hello? What is it?
What did you just say?
Shinji!
(indistinct announcementover P.A))
(footfalls rapidly approaching)

I'm so glad you're okay,Ayanami.
Um... so Father'snot here, huh?
Thank you for saving me.
- How?- How?
You sacrificed Unit 00in order to save my life.
Oh, so I saved you.
Yeah, don't you remember?
No, I don't know.
It's probably becauseI am the Third One.
Vang,
(footfalls)
(soft cracking)
These are tears?
This should be the first timeI'm seeing them,
but it feels likethis isn't the first time.
Am I the one crying?
Why am I... crying?
GENDOH:Yes, maintain the status quofor the First Children.
No need for new restrictions.
The same goesfor the Second and the Third.
Keep up surveillance.
Ikari, Chairman Keeland the others
won't be happyif they find out Rei survived.
The old men of Seele havesomething else to occupy them.
We needn't worry.
KEEL:We too would like to refrainfrom any extreme measures.
Violating you any further
or inflicting more sufferingis not our goal.
RITSUKO:I do not feelany humiliation at this time.
SEELE 03:What a strong-willed woman.
I can see why Ikariwanted you by his side.
SEELE 07:And yet you were brought here
before all of us by none otherthan Ikari himself.
KEEL:He refused to allow us
to interrogate the pilotof Unit 00
and had you sentas a proxy instead.
RITSUKO:I'm Rei's replacement?
Busy working.I'm sorry but please let me be.(answering machine beeps)
- (typing)- KAJI: This is partof the truth
you were looking for.
I've used 36 other meansto send this to you,
but they'll probably fail.
The only certain waywas this capsule.
This is everything I have.
Use it any way you want.
The passcode isour first fond memory.
Bye.Take care.
(printing)
I'm through with gettingall worked up
over a phone that doesn't ring.
'Cause I have your heart.It's with me now.
SEELE 03:Did we make the best choiceabout Dr. Akagi?
SEELE 11:This is differentthan Fuyutsuki.
It was for the bestto let her go.
SEELE 09:She's been instrumentalto the Eva series.
She can still bea benefit to us.
SEELE 07:Indeed.For the future of humanity.
SEELE 09:The Evangelions,we are about to have
eight of them available to us.
SEELE 11:So, that makes itanother four to go.
KEEL:The obliteration of Tokyo-3
is definitely going to bea boon for what we have planned.
Expedite the last four.
Once they are done,we will begin.
(phone ringing)
SHINJI:Yes, hello?
RITSUKO:Just listen to me.
You are no longerunder supervision.
You can safely go outside now.
Ms. Ritsuko?
(beeping)
(rapid beeping)
Huh.
- MISATO: It won't work.- (gun cocks)
- (gasps)- Not without my pass.
RITSUKO:I see. Kaji's handywork?
You're gonna let me see
all the secrets herewith my own eyes.
That's fine, but heis coming in with us.
It's a deal.
This is just likeAyanami's room.
This is Rei Ayanami's room.
This is whereshe was born and raised.
- SHINJI: Here?- RITSUKO: Yes.
This is where she was born.
The imagery of this roomhas left a strong impression
on the light and water thatcomprises Rei's deep psyche.
MISATO:Dr. Akagi, I did not comeall the way here to see this.
Yes, I know that, Misato.
SHINJI:Evas?
RITSUKO:The very first ones.
They were the failures,abandoned ten years ago.
SHINJI:An Eva graveyard.
RITSUKO:It's just a dumping ground.
It's also the placewhere your mother disappeared.
You may have no memory of it,
but you watched it all happen,
the momentwhen your mother disappeared.
(whimpering)
Ritsuko!
MISATO:This is what the Dummy Plugis made of?
I will reveal the truth to you.
(beep)
Ayanami.Are they...
- (gasps)- No way.
Are you telling methe Dummy Plugs...
Correct,this is the production line
for the Dummy Plug,
where the partsfor the core are made.
These are...
These are just empty dummies
and spare parts that are meantto be used for Rei.
Mankind came across a god
and then triedto make it their own.
15 years ago,God inflicted his wrath.
The god they wereso excited about disappeared.
Undeterred, they worked toresurrect their god themselves.
That was Adam.
Just like God,they made a human from Adam.
That was Eva.
SHINJI:Human?
Evas are human?
RITSUKO:Yes, they are.
Originally, Evas didn't havehuman souls.
Souls were embedded in them.
They were all madeof salvaged material.
The only one with a soulwas Rei.
She was the only onethat was born
containing a soul.
The Chamber of Gufwas now empty.
These thingsthat look like Rei,
they don't have a soul.
They're just empty vessels.
So I'll destroy them,because I hate 'em.
(beep)
(echoing laughter)
(gasps)No, Ritsuko.
Do you realizewhat you've done?
RITSUKO:Yes. I destroyed property.
Objects that aren't human,they're only shaped like humans.
And yet I couldn't competewith these things.
I wasn't good enough.
Thinking of himallowed me to endure
any humiliation, any violation.
My body means nothing to me.
And yet that man...
I should have known.
I'm such a fool.I am.
Mother and daughter,both of us were fools.
If you want to kill me,pull the trigger.
In fact, you'd bedoing me a favor.
That would be foolish, Ritsuko.
(Ritsuko sobbing)
MISATO:The tragedy of thoseobsessed with the Evas.
(sobbing continues)
And I'm no different.

GIRL:Mommy! Mommy!I've been chosen!
I'm gonna train to bean elite pilot
who protects all of humanity.
I'm the world's greatest!
It's supposed to be a secret,
but I want to share itjust with you, Mommy!
Lots of people will wantto be friends with me,
so I won't be lonely anymore!
I'll be fine,even without Daddy!
I won't be lonely anymore!
Look at me, Mommy!Please look at me!
Please, Mommy!
(slap)
ASUKA:Don't you dare make upstupid crap like that,
Shinji, you idiot!
SHINJI:How many timesdo I have to tell you?
He's gone!Mr. Kaji is gone!
It can't be.
(bird chirping)
Sync rate zero.
Not qualified to beSecond Children.
There's no reason for meto be here.
No one ever evensees me anymore.
Dad, Mom, no one at all.
So there's no reason leftfor me to live.
(clatter, crashing)
MAN:Are you Asuka Langley Soryu?
Intel Section Two reports
that they havethe Second Children
- safely in custody.- So...
first they lose track of her,
and then it takes themseven days to find her?
- That's not like them.- I'm sure it's intentional.
Maybe they did it to spite ushere in Operations.
MISATO:It's possible.
And Asuka's replacement,the Fifth,
is arriving today.This chain of events
seems likea well-written scenario.
- (car horn honks)- (insects buzzing)
Ayanami.
So, what I felt back then...
it was true.
It was Mother.
Rei Ayanami.Mother.
What are you doingwith them... Father?
Commander Ikari.
I found out my cat died.
The one that I had entrustedto my grandmother.
For far too long,I neglected that cat.
I'd been meaning to.
But then suddenlyit was all too late.
Why did you destroythe Dummy System?
I didn't destroythe Dummy System.
I destroyed Rei.
I ask you once more: why?
Because I no longer feelany joy in your embrace.
Why don't you dowhat you want with me?
With my body?Just like before?
- You disappoint me.- Disappoint?
You never expected much of me.
Never placed any hopein me, not once!
You wanted nothingof me, nothing!
Not a damn thing!
(crying)
What do I do now, Mother?What do I do?
I wonder,where did you go, Asuka?
But what am I supposed to do
if I do see her?Tell her about Ayanami?
(bird chirping)
SHINJI:Tohji and Kensuke.
Their families lost their homes,and they all moved away.
No one left.
There's no one left aroundthat I can call a friend.
No one.
I can't face Ayanami.
I'm too scared.
What will I say to her?How should I treat her?
Asuka...
Ms. Misato, Mother,
what should I do?
What am I supposed to do?
(humming "Ode to Joy")
(continues humming)
- Nice, isn't it?- Huh?
Music.It enriches the heart.
It's Lilin's highestcultural achievement.
Don't you agree...
Shinji Ikari?
- You know my name?- Well, who doesn't?
If I may be so bold,
you should really be more aware
of just how important you are.
Oh, should I?
And, uh, you are?
I'm Kaworu.Kaworu Nagisa.
Like you, I'm a childwhose path has been set out.
I'm the Fifth Children.
The Fifth Children?You're a...
um, how should I...?
Just call me Kaworu,Shinji Ikari.
Um, you can call mejust Shinji as well.
(chuckling)
MAKOTO:I got word thatthe Fifth Children
has just arrived.
MISATO:Kaworu Nagisa.
All background informationhas been deleted,
just like with Rei.
MAKOTO:But his date of birth is listed
as the same date thatthe Second Impact took place.
MISATO:This is a child sentdirectly by the council.
I'm sure there's more to thisthan it seems.
MAKOTO:The report fromthe Marduk Institute
has been withheldregarding the Fifth Children,
so I hacked intothe intelligence department
a bit to seeif I could find some info.
MISATO (sighs):That was a dangerous thingto do.
MAKOTO:But it was well worth it.
(whispering):I know where Ms. Ritsuko is.
What should we dowith the Fifth sync test?
MISATO:Let's see whathis abilities are.
We shouldn't try anythingout of the ordinary,
at least not for today.
WOMAN:Maintain contactwith current positions.
- Try lowering another 0.3.- Yes, sir.
(trilling)
And are these readingstruly reliable?
MAKOTO:All monitoring systems arefunctioning normally.
MAYA:No irregularitiesin the Magi's data
- can be detected.- I never imagined
this boy could synchronizewith Unit 02
without replacing the core.Quite astonishing.
MAYA:Sir, I still can'tbelieve this.
In terms ofthe systemic structure,
- it's impossible.- MISATO: But the factssay otherwise.
First we need to acceptthe facts as they are,
then we attempt to explain them.
WOMAN:Central Dogma iscurrently in lockdown.
- Please use Route 24as a detour.- (grunts)
So, you must bethe First Children, right?
Rei Ayanami.
You're built the same as I am.
We're very similar.
It seems we've bothcome to assume
the body type of the Lilinwho live here on this planet.
I'm sorry, who are you?
FUYUTSUKI:The Fifth Children has
- made contact with Rei.- I see.
The Magi is employingall of its resources
to analyze data on the Fifth.
MISATO:And yet his natureremains a mystery.
Who is he? This boy?
NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRYYOU COME IN, YOU DIE!
(coos)
Shinji still hasn'treturned either.
I'm a failureas a guardian, aren't I?
(orchestral "Ode to Joy"playing over earbuds)
WOMAN:Access to the Central Dogma
- is currently available.- (buzzer sounds)
Please use Route 3for movement.
Hello. Have you beensitting there, waiting for me?
Um, not really.
That's not exactlywhat I was...
KAWORU:What are you up to?
SHINJI:Well, with the routinetesting done,
all that's left to do istake a shower, then head home.
But, to be honest,
I don't like going homethese days.
The fact that you havea home to return to--
that's somethingto be happy about.
- It's a good thing.- You think so?
KAWORU:I'd like to keep talkingsome more.
Do you mind if I go with you?
- Uh...- To the shower?
- You're headed there, right?- Um, yeah.
Would you rather I didn't come?
No, um,it's not that I mind it...
(thuds)
KAWORU:You go to extremes to avoid
making first contact.
Are you afraidof intimacy with others?
If you keep clearof other people,
then you won't be betrayed.
You can avoidhurting each other.
But you won't stopfeeling lonely.
No one can be eternally freefrom loneliness,
because a person isultimately alone.
But people can live onby being able to forget.
(gasps)
(lights thud)
SHINJI:It's time.
KAWORU:Time's up already?
SHINJI:Yeah, we got to go to bed.
- KAWORU: With you?- SHINJI: No!
I think there's a roomready for you,
Kaworu, just for you.
I see.
Humans live witha constant feeling of pain
inside of their hearts.
But their hearts aresensitive to pain,
so it makes living difficult.
Their hearts aredelicate like glass.
- Yours especially.- You think so?
Yes. You're worthy of my grace.
- Your grace?- I'm saying I like you.
EPISODE 24
SEELE VOICE:NERV, an organization created
as the executive organof Seele.
SEELE 02:A body we created
to put our scenariointo action.
SEELE 09:It's become an institution
dedicated to the whimsof one man.
SEELE 02:Indeed, we mustreclaim ownership of it.
SEELE 04:Before the promised dayis at hand.
KEEL:We must return NERV
and the Eva seriesback to its original form.
Ikari, you will beheld accountable
for your betrayal of Seele.
The time remaining for usis quickly running out.
We haven't much longer.
But the Spear of Longinus,
capable of hindering us,IS how gone.
The final Angelwill appear soon.
Upon its elimination,our wishes will be fulfilled.
Soon, very soon, Yui.
(insects chirping)
Why am I here?
Why am I alive again?
All for what?
All for whom?
The Fifth Children?
That person.
He seemed a lot like me.
But why?
MISATO:Thankfully this place wasin the suburbs.
You were able to avoid beingcaught up in the mayhem.
- (coos)- But I worry that, next time,
we might not be so lucky.
So, starting tomorrow,you're gonna go stay
with Ms. Hiraki's family.
I have to say goodbyefor a while, Pen-Pen.
(squawks)
I should be the onesleeping on the floor.
It's fine. I'm the one thatmade you let me sleep in here.
I'm fine, really.
So, what did youwant to talk about?
Huh?
There's somethingyou wanted to tell me about,
isn't there?
A lot has happenedsince I came here.
Before I was a pilot,I was staying with a teacher.
Days there were calmand uneventful.
I was taking up space.
But that was just fine with me.
I didn't have anything elseI wanted to do.
You don't like other people?
It's not that.I just don't care, I guess.
But I always knewI didn't like my father.
I wonder why I talkabout things like this
with him.
- (chuckles)- (gasps)
I was thinkingthat perhaps I was born
just so that I could meet you.
(birds chirping)
KAWORU:Man cannot createsomething from nothing.
Man has to dependon something to do anything.
Man isn't a god after all.
KEEL:Yes, but there is a man
who endeavors to wield powerequal to that of a god.
SEELE 12:There is a man other than us
who aims to lift the lidfrom Pandora's Box once more.
SEELE 04:There is a man scheming
to slam shut the box
before the hopeat the bottom can appear.
(sighs)Hope.
That is, the hope of the Lilin.
SEELE 09:Hope exists in as many forms
as there are people.
KEEL:For hope only exists within
the confines of man's heart.
But our hope hasalready manifested itself.
SEELE 02:We, humanity,
the usurper successorswho arose from the Black Moon.
Our progenitor is Lilith.
SEELE 09:And the Angels,the true successors
who arose fromthe now-lost White Moon,
their progenitor is Adam.
KEEL:The soul which wassalvaged from Adam
has been embodied in you.
However, Adam's restoredphysical self has
been embodiedwithin Gendo Ikari.
KAWORU:In Shinji's father.
I have muchin common with him.
KEEL:Thus, it is with you
in whom we entrust our wish.
I'm fully aware of that.
It's the reason why I've cometo be here in this moment.
MISATO:It's no use.
He's too far away for meto be able to read his lips.
He gets up before dawn
and then spendshis time strolling around,
talking to himself?This kid's a wacko.
(gasps)
He noticed me?
That's impossible.
(sighs)
All will ridealong the Lilin's currents.
MISATO:So, have you been able
to get any data about him?
MAKOTO:Here itis. I borrowedthis information
without Lieutenant Ibuki'sknowledge.
MISATO:I'm sorry.
I keep asking youto act like a thief.
- (beep)- MISATO: What is this?
MAKOTO:No wonder Maya couldn'tshare this with others.
Theoretically,this is impossible.
MISATO:I agree. The mysterykeeps growing.
This boy freely changes
his synchronization rateswith an Eva.
And he does it by his own will?
Looks like I'm not gonna be ableto pull any punches.
(lights thud)
I'm surprised you made it here.
There's somethingI need to ask you.
You know all our conversationshere are recorded.
I don't care.That boy. The Fifth.
Who is he?
He's probablythe final messenger.
All right, let's go.
Come, Adam's alter egoand Lilin's loyal servant.
(soft whir)
- (buzzer sounds)- Eva Unit 02 activated!
How is that possible?Where's Asuka?
She's in Room 303!We verified it!
But thenwho could have activated...?
There's no entry pluginside Unit 02.
It's unmanned!
MISATO:No one's inside it?
- Not even the Fifth?- (beeping)
The Central Dogma has anA.T. Field generated inside it!
- Unit 02's?- No, a pattern blue!
This is not an error!It's an Angel!
How could that be?!
An Angel?That boy's an Angel?
(whirring)
MAN:A.T. Field...
MAN 2:Target has passed Level 4
and is continuing its descent!
SHIGERU:Ma'am, cannot cut powerto the mag-lift!
MAN 2:Target has passed Level 5!
Lockdown of all Central Dogma
emergency blast doors now!
Buy ourselves some time,no matter how little it is!
WOMAN:Activating Malebolge levels
emergency lockdown!All personnel evacuate now!
I never thoughtSeele would send an Angel
directly into HQ.
GENDOH:The old men have founda way to skip ahead,
and they want usto do it for them.
SEELE 02:Man has forgottentheir foolishness
and repeatsthe mistakes of the past.
SEELE 09:Man will never change
without first making atonement.
SEELE 02:We do not need Adam,nor do we need the Angels.
KEEL:We'll employ our means in orderto transform into the future.
Let us hope Unit 01 willbe able to carry out the task.
(booming)
The armored bulkheads are beingbreached by Unit 02!
Target has passed throughCocytus Number Two!
- Dispatch Eva Unit 01.- Roger.
Use any means necessaryto prevent the target
from enteringthe Terminal Dogma.
MISATO:But why did the Angelchoose Unit 02?
Perhaps it hopes to be ableto meld itself with Eva Unit 02.
GENDOH:Or it hopesto bring about our doom.
SHINJI:That's a lie! It must be!
Kaworu is an Angel?!It can't be true!
It's got to be a lie!
MISATO:It's a fact.You need to accept it.
You need to launch.Ready?
You're late, Shinji.
SHIGERU:Eva Unit 01,descending Route 02.
Pursuing target!
You betrayed me.
You betrayed the trustthat I put in you.
You betrayed mejust like Father.
SHIGERU:Unit 01 reached Level 4.
- Engaging with target.- Found him.
I've been waitingfor you, Shinji.
Kaworu!
Asuka, forgive me.
KAWORU:The Eva series.
Born of Adam,these should be abominations
in the eyes of man,and yet the Lilin will
use them if it'sfor their survival.
I simply don't understand.
Kaworu! Please stop!Why are you doing this?!
It's because the Eva and I sharesimilar bodies.
We were both bornas offspring of Adam,
so if it is empty of a soul,I can merge with it.
And Unit 02 hasconveniently withdrawn
its soul within itself.
- (booming)- (gasping)
- An A.T. Field?- Yes.
That is the Lilin termfor it, isn't it?
The sacred realmthat's impervious to others.
The light of the heart.
Deep down, the Lilin must know.
The A.T. Fields arethe inner walls
that everyone hasinside themselves.
How would I knowsomething like that, Kaworu?
- (booming)- (screaming)
MAN:Evas arrivedat the bottom level!
WOMAN:Target will arrivein Terminal Dogma in 20.
WOMAN 2:Both Eva units...
If Unit 01's signal is lost
and something majorstarts to happen, then...
I know what to do.I activate the self-destruct
for the facility, right?That would be better
than havingthe Third Impact take place.
- I can't thank you enough.- I'll be fine.
- I'm here with you.- Thank you.
KAWORU:Humanity's fate.
Man's hope is linedwith sorrow.
- What just happened?- A powerful A.T. Field,
like nothing we've ever seen!
Light waves, EM waves,subatomic particles blocked!
I cannot monitor the situation!
A true containment field.
MAYA:Lost tracking of the targetsEva Unit 02 and Unit 01.
Pilot communication is disabled!
(straining)
(gasps)Kaworu!
No! Wait!
- (beep)- Final safety systemsare disabled!
The Heaven's Door isnow opening up.
MISATO:The Angel made it to its goal.
So, Hyuga.
(screaming)
- What's that?- Status report.
- MAKOTO: An A.T. Field.- It's an A.T. Field
of equal magnitudeto the one that constructed
the containment fieldnear the Terminal Dogma!
And it's now enteringthe containment field!
Can't be-- another Angel?
Cannot verify that--wait, it's gone?
I no longer have readings.
It's gone?The Angel left?
Adam, the mother-likeentity for us.
Must those born from Adamreturn back to Adam,
bringing about man's doom?
No, wait, this isn't... Lilith?
So that's it.That's your plan, Lilin.
(snarling)
I have to thank you, Shinji.
I wanted you to stop Unit 02.
If you hadn't,then it might have continued
to live alongside of her.
Kaworu, why do this?
Because even if it meanshumanity perishes
in the process, fate dictatesthat I will live on.
But I could die right herein this moment.
For me, there is equal valuein life and death.
Choosing to die isthe one and only choice
that no one cantake away from you.
Wait, what?Kaworu...
I don't understandwhat you're trying to say to me.
It doesn't make any sense.
Just my final words.
Right, now make me disappear.
If you don't,humanity will be eliminated.
Only one life-formwill evade extinction
and be granted a future.
And I've cometo the conclusion that
you shouldn't bethe one to die.
You and your kindneed a future.
Thank you, Shinji.I'm so happy...
I could meet you.
>!
>!
(crunching)
SHINJI:Kaworu said...
I was worthy of his grace.
That was the first time
someone told me they liked me.
He was just like me.
Just like Ayanami, too.
I liked him.
And if only one of ushad to survive,
then it should have been him.
He was a much nicer personthan me by a long shot.
Kaworu should've beenthe one that survived.
No, Shinji. Only those who havethe will to live can survive.
He craved death.
He cast aside the will to live
and attached himselfto a false hope.
Shinji, you are not at fault.
That's cold, Ms. Misato.
(piano music playing)
>!
>!

WASN'T HE AS HUMAN AS YOU ARE?
Angel! Angel! Not human!
He was another personjust like me.
No! He was an Angel.
Is that why you killed him?
Of course.
Or else we'd be dead.
We would've all been killed.
Is that why you killed him?
I didn't want to kill him!
There was no other way.
SO YOU KILLED HIM

SO YOU KILLED HIM
Someone help me!
SO YOU KILLED HIM
Please!Please!
Someone help me!
SHINJI:It's true.
If only one of ushad to survive,
then it should have been him.
He was a much nicer personthan me, by a long shot.
Kaworu should've beenthe one that survived.
MISATO:No, Shinji.
Only those with the willto live survive.
He craved death.He cast aside the will to live
and attached himselfto a false hope.
Shinji, this is not your fault.
SHINJI:Really?
ANXIETY
What I did, was it really okay?
What I did, was it really okay?FIXATION
I don't know.What should I do?
What exactly should I do?
What exactly should I do?WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?
Fear?
Fear?WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?
Myself.
Myself.WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?
Being rejected.
Being rejected.WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?
By whom? But who?
By whom? But who?WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?
By whom? But who?
By whom? But who?WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?
WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?
I'm afraid of... Father.
I was abandoned by Father.
He hated me.
What will I doif people hate me?
What should I do?
SHINJI:Where am I?
Where am I supposed to go now?
I can't see the way.
I can't make anything out.
Ms. Misato?Ms. Misato?
Hey, where are you,
Ms. Misato?
Wait, where am I supposedto go from here?
Ms. Misato?
Asuka, Ayanami, Tohji,
Kensuke, Ms. Ritsuko,
Mr. Kaji, Father...
Mother.
Please, someone tell me.
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.
(booming)
It's Evangelion Unit 01.
Does this mean in the end
I'll be stuckpiloting this thing
even if it meanskilling people I like?
Piloting it 'cause Fatherand everyone says to?
Am I supposed to get insideand fight with it again?
Mother, say something!
Answer me!
WHY DO YOU PILOT THE EVA?
Because people tell me to.
THAT'S WHY YOU PILOT THE EVA?
What's wrong with that?
It's for everybody's sake.Why shouldn't I?
YOU PILOT THE EVA TO HELP EVERYONE? TO HELP OTHERS?
That's right! It's a good thing!
It's a really good thing to do.
Everybody praises mewhen I do it!
They're so nice to me then!
You're lying! You're an idiot!
That means you're actuallydoing it for yourself.
- (gasping)- You're making up excuses
for yourself,like you usually do!
Am 1?
You're holdingonto this mentality
that you're doing your very bestto serve others,
but that's just a copout,and you know it!
Is it really?
You're lonely.No two ways about it, Shinji.
I am?
You are in a convenientsymbiotic relationship!
- And that's dependency!- Maybe that's it.
You're hoping you will besought after by others.
That's the thingthat's actually motivating you.
That might be true.
You're alwaysjust sitting around,
waiting for someoneto hand out what you want.
You're waitingfor false happiness.
- You do the same.
- You're no different.- (gasps)
OUR SECOND CHARACTER
THE CASE OF ASUKA LANGLEY SORYU
(bubbling)
ASUKA:I don't remember getting in,
but here I aminside the Eva again,
forced inside.
This thing's faulty.
It won't move in any case.
No... I'm actuallythe one that's faulty.
(sobbing):No one wants me.
No one would want me!
No one is going to want a pilot
who can't even board an Eva.
REI:You want othersto confirm your identity.
Shut up!
Shut up!SEPARATION ANXIETY
REI:You're afraid of being alone,aren't you?
SEPARATION ANXIETY
You're afraid thatyou'll lose yourself
when others go away.
SEPARATION ANXIETY
YOUNG ASUKA: That's why you pilot an Eva.
ATTACHMENT BEHAVIOR
YOUNG ASUKA: That's why you pilot an Eva.
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up! ATTACHMENT BEHAVIOR
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
I don't need someone that's like a doll to tell me all that!
OUR THIRD CHARACTER
THE CASE OF REI AYANAMI
- Who are you?-
Rei Ayanami.
Who are you, really?
REI AYANAMI
You are also Rei Ayanami?
I am the object
that is referred to as Rei Ayanami.
We are all objects referred to as Rei Ayanami.
How is it that all of you are also me?
Because all of us are
referred to by others as the object Rei Ayanami.
Do you realize that you have a heart
and a body that are forgeries?
These are not forgeries.
I am who I am.
REI: No, you're not--don't you see?
You are a person with a forged soul,
made by the human Gendoh Ikari.
Merely a fake object
pretending to be a human being.
Look inside.
Inside you, there's an impenetrable abyss,
a heart that you can't figure out.
The real you is in there.
I am who I am.
I became who I am with the passage of time,
through the experiences I had,
and through my connections with others.
REI:I took on the shape of who I am now
through interacting with others.
The shape that my heart takes on
has changed as I interacted with people and time went by.
THOSE ARE LINKS?
Yes, connections are the things
that make the person that isreferred to as Rei Ayanami
and will make who that personwill be in the future.
THOSE ARE LINKS
But separately from that exists
who you really are.
You don't know.That's all it is.
You're just avoiding her,subconsciously,
because you don't wantto see her.
BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID
Afraid that it might not even
have the shape of a person.
Afraid who you were up to now
might fade away and disappear.
YOU'RE AFRAID
You're afraid thatwho you are now will vanish.
You're afraid you'll disappearfrom everyone's hearts.
- You're afraid.- Afraid? I don't understand.
It means your own personal world
disappears as well.
ISN'T THAT SCARY?
And so you will disappear.
ISN'T THAT SCARY?
No, I'd be happy.
Because I want to die.
Because I long for despair.
I want to return to the void.
REI:But I can't.I can't return to the void.
He won't let me go back.
He won't let me. Not yet.
He needed me.
And so I have to be here.
But it will end.
I won't be needed anymore.
I'll be abandoned by him.
I used to long for the daythat that would happen.
But now I'm afraid.
(clatter)
Let us go.
This is the day.
You existed for today, Rei.
Yes.
THUS...
THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF HUMANITY BEGINS
EPISODE 25: THE ENDING WORLD
RETURNING TO SHINJI IKARI
SHINJI:What is this sensation?
It feels like somethingI felt once before.
It's like the outlinesof my body are melting away.
It feels good.
I feel like I am getting bigger,
expanding out,forever and ever... and ever.
THIS WAS HOW EVERYONE'S INSTRUMENTALITY BEGAN
PARTS THEY WERE MISSING
HEARTS THEY HAD LOST
THAT EMPTINESS IN THEIR HEARTS WAS FILLED
NSTRUMENTALITY OF THE HEART, THE SOUL, BE
EVERYONE'S INSTRUMENTALITY BEGINS,
RETURNING EVERYTHING TO NOTHINGNESS
Incorrect.
We are not returningto the void.
We are simply returningeverything to where it started.
We are merely returningto the mother that
has been lost from this world.
All hearts become oneand attain eternal peace.
There is nothing moreto this than that.
That's the InstrumentalityProject?
Yes. We all haveparts of our hearts
that remain hollow and empty.
They're parts we've lost.
THIS CAUSES EMOTIONAL STARVATION
THIS CAUSES EMOTIONAL ANXIETY AND FEAR
All people fear the darknesswithin their hearts,
and they press on living,hoping to escape from it,
to eradicate it.
But that darkness willnever go away.
As long as people are people.
What? And that's whywe should combine
all our hearts into one?
So we can supplement each other?
Just force this upon everyonewithout their consent?
You're forcing peopleto care for each other.
But that's exactlywhat you desired inside,
- isn't that right?- (gasping)
Where am I?
THE CASE OF MISATO KATSURAGI
My heart isn't just in me.
My heart is insideMs. Misato's heart.
And at the same time,my heart is
inside Shinji's heart.Is that it?
In order for meto truly find myself,
I will need to interactwith many other people.
I will need to peer deeplyinside myself.
I will need to examine carefully
the Ms. Misato within me.
Ms. Misato,what do you wish for?
DO YOU WANT TO BE A GOOD GIRL?
YOUNG MISATO:I need to be a good girl.
WHY?
'Cause Daddy is always gone.
I need to be a good girland help Mommy.
But I don't wantto end up like Mommy.
Mommy is always cryingwhen Daddy's away.
I shouldn't cry.I shouldn't act spoiled.
That's why I need to bea good girl.
And I'll make sureDaddy won't hate me.
But I hate my father.
That's why I hatebeing a good girl.
I hate it all. I'm tired.
I'm tired of stayingclean and pretty.
I'm tired of the me pretendingto be clean and pretty.
So tired.
I want to be soiled.
I want to see myself dirty.
That's why you slept with him?
- Let him have you?- No.
I slept with himbecause I loved him.
Were you reallyin love with him?
Yes, I was, and he accepted me
for who I am,what I really am inside.
ARE YOU SURE?
He was kind to me.
- (whirring)- (rattling)
No! Please don'tshow this to Shinji!
I don't want himto see me like this!
Well, it's nothingto get embarrassed about
- at this stage.- It's embarrassing!
MISATO:Why is it embarrassing?
In front of the man you love,you're more than comfortable,
no, overjoyed,to show yourself like this.
No! Please stop!
Honestly, you're thrilledto show yourself like this.
You're proud, aren't you?
That's a lie! No! No, I'm not!
Oh, I wonder.I think you're actually eager
to show yourself offto your father.
- No!- You sought peace of mind
by looking at Kaji's facewhile he was sleeping.
- No!- You sought out comfort
in the feeling of Kaji's warmth.
- No!- You sought out
the love of your fatherin the arms of Kaiji.
No, I didn't!
I admit it.
Even back then,I recognized my father in Kaiji.
Saw little moments of him.
That's why I ran away from Kaji.
I was afraid.
It felt likeFather and I were...
but, honestly,I ran because I was delighted.
It felt so pleasurable.
Those were momentsof captivating bliss.
And I hated that.
That's why I ended it.
Huh, they say you don't needa reason to fall in love,
but there's alwaysa reason behind breaking up.
You're so kind to me, Kaji.
So please be kind to me...once more.
And mess me up.
You shouldn't tryhurting yourself
simply because you don't likewho you are right now.
You'd only be deceiving yourselfwith a punishment
that's fleeting and impulsive.
That isn't what you want.
MISATO:You're telling me
I should take care of myself,aren't you?
Men are all like that.
And then they go off to work,
their own worlds,
and just leave me behind.
Father was just like that.
They're just avoidingharsh reality.
Life's nastiness.
That's me, isn't it?
Of course.I'm atrocious that way.
It can't be helped.
Please stop, Ms. Misato!
There are timeswhen I think that I'm hopeless!
- I'm disgusting!- Indecent. How filthy.
- Just appalling.- So smutty! Absolutely gross!
If that's whatadult relationships are like,
- I want to throw up.- Congratulations.
Way to go on your promotion,Major Katsuragi.
MISATO:The person that won recognition
is the me playing the roleof the do-gooder.
That's not the real me.
YOUNG MISATO:The real you is cryingall the time.
No... I'm happy.
AM I HAPPY?
I am happy.
AM I HAPPY?
Yes, I am happy.
AM I HAPPY?
I'm not! This is notreal happiness!
WHAT IS HAPPINESS?
The person you seeis not the real me!
I'm just convincing myselfthat it is!
But to keep on living,
we have to do thatfor ourselves.
We get scaredof who we are without others.
- You become anxious.- Unless you're sleeping
- next to someone.- Are you afraid to sleep alone?
So sleeping by yourselfmakes you feel lonely, huh?
Your heart can't toleratemissing parts of itself.
That's why you'll make dowith just anyone.
Stop it!
MISATO:In fact, you just want to bathe
in cheap thrills.
You want to easeyour heart's suffering
with impulsive escapism.
You're just using menfor that purpose.
I'm not! No. No!
WHAT COULD SHE BE WISHING FOR?
Wait... where am I?
This is my heart inside Asuka.
And at the same time,
my heart inside Shinji?Is that it?
THE CASE OF ASUKA LANGLEY SORYU
SHINJI:Asuka, what do you wish for?
ASUKA:I will live on my own.
I don't need Daddy or Mommy.
I can live on my own.
I won't cry anymore.
- (sobbing)- I am still crying.
Why am I crying?
MOTHER:I'm trying, but I'm notat all good with her.
FATHER:I thoughtyou'd be more confident.
You're a doctor, after all.
MOTHER:A doctor isa human being as well.
I've said this to you before.
FATHER:But how could a woman like yoube uneasy about a child?
MOTHER:Well, she seems to bestrangely mature at times.
So uptightand absolutely unapproachable.
She scares me from time to time.
Dear, haven't you feltthat way about her as well?
FATHER:Not really. In any case,
you've how becomeAsuka's mother.
MOTHER:I'll remind you, I becameyour wife first. Thank you.
FATHER:You assumed bothat the same time.
MOTHER:Yes, in terms ofsocietal roles, that's true.
But while there's no wayyou could ever stop
being her father,I could conceivably
stop being her motherwhenever I wanted to.
FATHER:Yes, I suppose that's true.
Mommy, don't! Pleasedon't stop being my mommy!
I'll be a good girl!A good girl that you'll like!
So please don't stopbeing my mommy!
Please pay attention to me!
Please, Mommy! (sobbing)
Please don't kill me!
KYOKO:Your daddy cameto dislike your mommy.
Didn't want her.
No.Daddy never really liked Mommy.
Daddy never really needed Mommy,that's it.
That's why you should diewith Mommy.
Daddy doesn't want us,so we should die.
YOUNG ASUKA:Am I a bother?
Am I unwanted?
KYOKO:Please, die with me, Asuka.
- (dogs barking)- No! I'm not your doll, Mommy!
I'm gonna thinkand live for myself!
ASUKA:When I found her,
my mother was hangingfrom the ceiling.
Her face-- to me,she seemed so happy.
So content.
But I hated that face so much.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to fade awayand disappear.
I don't want boys and romance.
I don't want Dad.I don't want Mom.
I don't want anyone!
No one is willing to protect me.
No one will be on my side.
WHAT DOES SHE WISH FOR?
That's why I'm gonnalive for myself.
But I don't want to!It's so painful!
I don't want to be alone.
I don't wantto be alone!
I don't want to be alone!
SHINJI:Don't abandon me.
MISATO:Don't cast me aside.
ASUKA:Don't kill me.
What is this?
This is the HumanInstrumentality Project
that your father was working on.
- Itis?- Seems this is part of it.
ASUKA:The truth is somethingwe might not ever really know.
RITSUKO:But what we areexperiencing right now
are nothing more than facts.
REI:Valid within you.
FUYUTSUKI:And the memory of those facts
translates to becomeyour reality.
RITSUKO:Some truths will transform
with the passage of time.
SHINJI:These are facts.
These are all the results?These are all--
ASUKA:Among the multitudeof facts that exist,
this is one set.
MISATO:And this is the resultyou wished for.
SHINJI:I wished for this?
REI:Yes, you wished for destruction.
For a worldwhere no one is saved.
SHINJI:No! It's just a world
where no one saved--saved me.
RITSUKO:No one can save you.
KAJI:This is what you wished for.What you wanted.
ASUKA:The destruction. The deaths.
The return to the void.
These are things you wished for.
MISATO:This is reality.
SHINJI:What is reality?
REI:Reality is your world.
MAKOTO:It's your own world
that you share with others
in time and space.
SHIGERU:It's the world where you decide
how you accept things.How you recognize things.
MAYA:Right now, it's your own world
where you just receivewhat others give.
THAT IS REALITY
It's your own world thatyou can't do anything about.
It's a world where everything'sall decided for me, right?
RITSUKO:No, it isn't.It's a world you decide.
FUYUTSUKI:It's a world whereyour heart decides
the way that things will be.
THAT IS REALITY
REI:The will to live.
ASUKA:And the desire to die.
Those are the thingsyou wished for.
SHINJI:This darkness.
This haphazard world.
You're saying this iswhat I wished for?
ASUKA:That's right.
KAJI:You wished for a closed-off
world that's comfortablefor you and only you.
MAKOTO:So that you could protectyour frail heart.
SHIGERU:So that you could protectyour pleasure.
MAYA:This is just the end result.
MISATO:People can't live in a realmthat's closed off,
in a world that's yours alone.
ASUKA:But you wished for a world,
for the world around you,to be closed off. Removed.
RITSUKO:Rejecting what you disliked.
Removing all discomfort.
Your own heart yearnedfor a lonely world.
REI:Those desires createdthis tiny world
of tranquility of the heartjust for you.
But what's been shaped here
is only one possible ending.
This here isthe end of the world
that you yourself brought about.
AND THUS, THIS QUEST FOR INSTRUMENTALITY IS...
TO BE CONTINUED
(piano music playing)

NARRATOR:Endings.
They can always be foundafter a beginning.
Will our wishes leadto our destruction?
Is our hope death itself?

THE INSTRUMENTALITY
IAT PEOPLE HAD LOST, THAT IS, OF THE HEART, WAS UNDE
ER, IT WOULD TAKE FAR TOO LONG TO DEPICT ALL SUCHE
NE WILL THEREFORE FOCUS ON THE INSTRUMENTALITY OF
'HE HEART BELONGING TO THE BOY SHINJI IKAF
THE CASE OF SHINJI IKARI
ASUKA:The terror that I'll disappear.
SHINJI:Though I feel like it'd be fineif I disappeared.
- REI: Why is that?- ASUKA: 'Cause no one wants me.
I'm an unwanted human being.
SHINJI:I knew it.I'm an unwanted child.
I don't matter to anyone,and I never have!
You're running awaybecause you think
nothing matters, aren't you?
You're afraidof screwing it up, aren't you?
You're terrified of havingpeople hate you, aren't you?
You're scaredto look at the weakness
- inside you, aren't you?- Yeah, well, you're no different
- than I am, Ms. Misato.- That's right.
We all sharethese thoughts and feelings.
There's something in our heartsthat's missing.
- And we're terrified of it.- We're anxious.
And that is why we are alltrying to meld into one.
We're trying to fill ineach other's gaps.
REI:That is the InstrumentalityProject.
FUYUTSUKI:People must livein packs to survive.
GENDOH:People cannot live on their own.
Notice of TransferShinji IkariRITSUKO: Even though,in the end, they are alone.
KAJI:That's why it's so painful.
ASUKA:That's why it's so lonely.
MISATO:That's why we want to embraceeach other's hearts and bodies.
REI:We want to be one.
FUYUTSUKI:Human beings are made upof fragile things.
RITSUKO:Their hearts and bodiesare made up of fragile things.
GENDOH:That is why we mustcomplete one another
through instrumentality.
WHY?
Because we won't surviveif we do not do so.
Tell me, why are you alive?
I DON'T KNOW.
ASUKA:I guess I liveto find that answer.
Tell me, who do you live for?
ASUKA:I live for myself, who else?
SHINJI:For myself, probably.
IS THAT TRUE?
REI:Are you happy to be alive?
I don't know.
REI:Are you happy to be alive?
ASUKA:Of course I'm happy.
REI:Are you happy to be alive?
MISATO:I only want to do thingsthat are fun.
KAJI:You don't like being alone?
MISATO:I don't like it.
KAJI:You don't like being hurt?
MISATO:I don't like it.
KAJI:That's why you ran away?
MISATO:That's right.
What's wrong with running awayfrom hurt and pain?
oy TpeSHINJI:Don't run away.
What is the reasonfor not running away?
SHINJI:It's painful to run away.
Even though it's painyou are running away from?
SHINJI:It's painful.
If what you're running away fromis painful,
then that's perfectly fine.
She's right.
It's okay to run awayif it's painful.
If you really don't wanttodoiit,
then it's okay to run.
SHINJI:But I don't want to!
I don't want to run awayanymore!
I won't. Running away is wrong.
MISATO: You won't run awaybecause you feel if you do,
MISATO: You won't run awaybecause you feel if you do,
it will only bring more pain.
it will only bring more pain.
ASUKA:You've felt that pain beforewhen you've run away.
REI:That is whyyou don't want to run away.
SHINJI:And if I run away,no one will talk to me again.
Don't leave.
Please, don't abandon me!
RITSUKO:Maybe that's whyhe's so quick to obey others.
Makes life easier for him.
SHINJI:It is.
If I don't,then I'll be abandoned again.
ASUKA:You don't want to be hurt,do you?
MISATO:You're just assumingall this, aren't you?
KENSUKE:You think you're the only onethat gets hurt.
TOHJI:You thinkyou're the only one with issues.
HIKARI:It's easier for youif you think this way.
- It lifts the burden.- SHINJI: Shut up!
That has nothingto do with this!
What I think and what I amdon't mean anything!
MISATO:Once again, you're casting asideyour self-worth.
REI:But I don't have any.
ASUKA:And there you go again,assuming you're worthless.
MISATO:You're hopingyou won't hurt anyone
if you think like thatand don't do anything.
ASUKA:You rely on othersfor praise and approval
to keep yourself going.
SHINJI:But no one accepts who I am.
MISATO:You assume that of others.
SHINJI:That's whyI need to pilot the Eva.
MISATO:You just assumeyou are worthless.
You've been doing thatsince the very beginning.
SHINJI:But I am!
KENSUKE:No, you're not.
TOHJI:These are just thoughtsyou've put in your head, bud.
SHINJI:You're wrong. I am worthless.
I can't be proud of anything.
ASUKA:That's why I pilot the Eva.
SHINJI:By piloting the Eva,I can exist as myself.
ASUKA:By piloting the Eva,
I can exist as myself.
SHINJI:Before I became an Eva pilot,
I was a nobody.
I can stay hereif I remain an Eva pilot.
ASUKA:I have nothing else.
REI:I have nothing else.
SHINJI:I have nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
MY LIFE'S VALUE
I don't have that.
...THAT'S WHY
I hate myself.
(beeps)
ASUKA:I hate you!
I hate you so much,I could die!
TOHJI:Oh, man,I absolutely hate your guts.
KENSUKE:I really don't like you.I really don't.
HIKARI:Sorry, but the thing is,I really don't like you.
- RITSUKO: I don't like you.- MAKOTO: I do hate you.
SHIGERU:Geez, I hate you.
MAYA:I can't stand you.I despise you.
KAJI:I don't like what you are.
MISATO:I hate you.
SHINJI:You see? Everybody does hate me.
I'm sure that's whatthey think inside.
School Transfer Form: Shinji IkariI'm sure that's whatthey think inside.
REI:That's just what you thinkothers are thinking, isn't it?
SHINJI:You're wrong!
No, I know they do,'cause I hate myself.
REI:That's exactly whyyou think others hate you.
I HATE YOU!REI:That's exactly whyyou think others hate you.
I HATE YOU!
I HATE YOU!ASUKA:I hate it! I hate it!I hate it so much.
I HATE YOU!
SHINJI:But they do praise me sometimes.
They show their gratitude for mewhen I pilot the Eva.
People give me their approval.
THAT MAKES ME HAPPY
People praise me.
BUT I'M NOT HAPPY
REI:How do you really feel?
SHINJI:I don't know.
I mean, both of those feelingsare real.
MISATO:And that's whyyou pilot the Eva.
SHINJI:The Eva is all I have right now.
REI:If you're not a pilot,you can't be you.
MISATO:Eva Unit 01is tied to your heart.
There's no doubt about that.
RITSUKO:But if you depend on the Eva,
then who you arewill be dictated by the Eva.
KAJI:The Eva will completely defineeverything about you.
MISATO:But who you really arewill fade away and disappear.
SHINJI:Good!
There was nothing specialabout me before.
Even when I learned the cello,that didn't mean anything.
ASUKA:You've never done anythingout of your own desire.
SHINJI:But now, I can pilot the Eva.
ASUKA:And when you lose the Eva,you'll feel powerless
and unable to do anything,just like me.
WHY DO YOU PILOT THE EVA?
Being a pilotis all there is to me.
FINAL EPISODE: THE BEAST THAT SHOUTED 'l' AT THE HEART OF THE WORLD
SHINJI:Rain.
Rain always makes me feel down,
like how I feel right now.
I don't like it.
REI:Dusk... life fading away.
I hope for that.
I don't like it.
ASUKA:Daybreak. A day begins.
A day that I hate begins.
I don't like it.
SHINJI:Blue skies. Something warm.
Something I'm not used to.
Something scary.
Something I don't need.I don't like it.
ASUKA:I hate everyone. I hate them!
What do you wish for?
YOU'RE AFRAID OF ANXIETY?
What do you really want in life?
YOU WANT SOLACE?
Tell me,what are you looking for?
DON'T HATE ME!
- (fabric tearing)- ASUKA: Don't hate me!
I'm terrified of...
REJECTION
What I want is...
CONTACT AND ACCEPTANCE
SHINJI:Is it okay if I'm next to you?
REI:Is it okay if I'm here?
ASUKA:Do you love me?
DO YOU LOVE
Do you want to gobe with your mother?
ASUKA:I don't want to go.
Aren't you going to gobe with your father?
SHINJI:I don't want to go.
And why not?
- (crying)- SHINJI: Because I'm afraidof not being liked.
- (crying)- ASUKA: Because I mightno longer exist if I do.
THAT'S WHY?
What do you wish for?
RELIEF FROM ANXIETY
Tell me, what do you seek?
RELIEF FROM LONELINESS
You don't want to feelhappiness?
I can't have thatuntil I have this.
I want to have value.
If I have that,they won't abandon me.
They'll take care of me.
I WANT VALUE
That is somethingyou have to discover
all on your own,your self-worth.
SOI PILOT THE EVA
I'm nothing. I'm worthless.
I'm not worthy enoughto continue living.
Tell me, what are you, really?
SHINJI:What am I?
What the hell am I?!
What? This is... me!
The shape others see me as.
The symbol for me.
This is... this is...this is...
SHINJI IKARI
this is everythingthat represents me.
This is the only wayhow people recognize me.
Then... what am I?
WHERE AM I?
This is me. The real me.
The fake me.
REI:You are you.
However,there is a distinction
between youand what it means to be you.
SHINJI:There is.
My clothes... my shoes...
my room...they're all part of who I am.
REI:Those are all things connectedto your consciousness.
SHINJI:What I feel is me being me.
I am, in the end, myself.
But who am I? Where am I?
What am I? What am I?
AND SO, YOU WISH TO CLOSE OFF YOUR HEART(door slamming)
No one would ever understandsomeone like me.
Stop being an idiot.Of course they wouldn't!
Figuring out someone like thatis impossible to do.
MISATO: The only personthat can understand you,
that can heal you,is, in the end, you.
That is why you needto take care of this yourself.
None of that mattersbecause there's no real me!
I don't know myself!
How can I take care of myself?!
YOU'RE ANXIOUS
You are anxious.
Right now, you're afraid.
Afraid of everyone around you.
Afraid of the environmentthat surrounds you.
MISATO: But your surroundingswon't stay the same forever.
ASUKA: Time will alwaysflow around you.
REI: Your world is madeof a constant stream of changes.
Your world will change accordingto what is in your heart
at any given moment.
SHINJI:What is this?
A blank world?
A world devoid of people?
YOUNG SHINJI:A world of freedom!
- SHINJI: Freedom?- YOUNG SHINJI: Yes.
A world of freedomwhere you're not tied down
by anything.
SHINJI:This is freedom?
YOUNG SHINJI:Yes! A totally free world!
REI:However, it is empty.
SHINJI:Unless I think of something?
MISATO:Yes.
Unless you think of something.
SHINJI:Think of what?
I don't knowwhat I should think of.
REI:Are you afraid?
ASUKA:You can't picture yourself?
YOUNG SHINJI:It's too blurry.
MISATO:A world of ambiguity.
THAT IS FREEDOM
KAJI:A world where youcan do what you want.
MISATO:The problem is,you're filled with anxiety.
FUYUTSUKI:You don't know what to do.Isn't that it?
SHINJI:What should I do?
GENDOH:I'll impose a limit.
- (marker squeaking)- ASUKA: There, now you haveup and down.
REI:But now, you've lostone degree of freedom.
MISATO:Now, you must standon the ground.
KAJI:But you feel safer, don't you?
MAKOTO:The anxiety inside youhas decreased.
SHIGERU:Then you try to walk.
MAYA:This is your will.
SHINJI: My will?Is that what this is?
RITSUKO:A world with a horizon
is a world that existsaround you.
TOHJI:But hey, you can move aroundall you want.
KENSUKE:And if you really wanted to,
you could change the positionof this world.
HIKARI:Also, the position of the world
doesn't have to be a constant.
KAJI:It changes alongwith the passage of time.
FUYUTSUKI:You can change as well.
GENDOH:Your shape depends onwhat's inside your heart
and what surrounds youin the world.
RITSUKO:In the end, this is your world.
MISATO:Your perceptionof the nature of reality.
THAT IS REALITY
SHINJI:This is... an empty space.
An empty world.
Devoid of everything except me.
I'm startingto become indistinct.
I feel myself disappearing.
The being that is meis fading away.
WHY?
YUI: That's becauseyou're the only thing here.
SHINJI:I'm alone.
YUI:If nothing exists besides you,
then you will not be ableto understand your shape.
SHINJI:My shape?
MY SELF IMAGE?
MISATO:Yes, you learn your shape
by looking and comparingto the shapes of others.
ASUKA:You envision yourselfby looking at the walls
that separate yourselffrom others.
REI:You cannot see yourself
unless there are otherswith you.
SHINJI:I can only be mewhen others are with me.
One person will always bejust one person,
no matter what.
The entire worldwould only be me.
MISATO:You understand your own shape
through examining how differentyou are from others.
REI:The first is your mother.
ASUKA:Your mother is a differentperson than you are.
SHINJI:Of course, 'cause I am me.
But then, at the same time,it's clear to me now
that other peoplemake up parts of my heart.
MISATO:That's correct, Shinji Ikari.
ASUKA:You just now figured that out?
Idiot Shinji!
(gasps)
(birds chirping)
It's about time you woke up,idiot Shinji.
(yawning):Oh, it's just you, Asuka.
- (yawning)- What do you mean, just me?
I go out of my own wayevery single morning
to make sure you aren'trunning late for school.
Can't you botherto show a bit more appreciation
to your childhood friend?
(yawning):Yeah. Sure, thanks.
But if you could let me sleepa little bit more.
Stop being such a slob!
Snap out of itand get up already!
(crashing)
(gasps, groaning)
- (slap)- Ah! You pervert!
I can't believe you!
SHINJI:It's not my fault.
This always happensin the morning.
YUL:That Shinji.
It's very kind of Asukato pick him up like this.
I wish he was more appreciative.
- GENDOH: Yeah.- YUI: Gendoh, honey,
don't you thinkyou should put the paper down
and start getting readyfor work?
- GENDOH: Yeah.- YUI: You see?
Even though you're a grown man,
you're no different than Shinji.
GENDOH:Are you ready to go?
YUL:Yes, I've been waiting for you.
Come on, dear,you know I'm the one
Mr. Fuyutsuki complains towhen we're late to the meeting.
GENDOH:That's becauseyou're irresistible.
YUL:Stop being sillyand get dressed already.
GENDOH:Yeah.
I know... Yui.
ASUKA:Come on, we need to go!
SHINJI:I know, I know. We're going.
You're sucha fussy busybody, Asuka.
ASUKA:What was that?!
(slap)
All right, we're leaving now.
- Bye, Mrs. Ikari.- Bye, Mom.
YUL:Okay, have a nice day at school.
Gendoh, please!
Get your noseout of that newspaper.
GENDOH:Yeah. I know, Yui.
(birds singing)
(horns honk)
Hey, I heard another studentis transferring in.
Yeah, well,since they're making this city
the new capital next year,I wouldn't be surprised.
I think more and more peoplewill move in.
That makes sense.I wonder if it's a girl.
What if she's cute?
(Asuka groaning)
(panting)
Oh, geez, I'm gonna be late!
There's no wayI can let my first day of school
get off on the wrong foot.
(gasps)
(crash)
(Shinji and Rei wincing)
Huh? Ah!
(giggles) Sorry about that.
Gotta run.
I'm really sorry, but it wasnice running into you!
Oh...
(groans)
You Te ap, idjoy
TOHJI: That's unbelievable!You,re an Idjoy
Did you get a good look?You know, her panties?YouU're an idiog
I wouldn't sayI got a good look at them.
- More of just a peek.- (gasping)
Oh, man, you reallylucked out big this morning.
Ah-gah-gah-gah!
Hey, what's the big idea,class rep?
- That hurts!- Too bad.
'Cause this is nothingcompared to the crap
you're pulling this morning.
Listen,you're on duty this week,
and you forgot the vases.Go change the water.
TOHJL:Ugh, why are yousuch a pain in my...
- Ah!- HISAKI: Excuse me?!
She's got Tohjiright under her thumb.
He's such a wimp.
Like you're any different.
SHINJI:What do you mean?
You're sayingI'm under a girl's thumb?
ASUKA:What?
I'm just stating the obvious.
SHINJI:What do you mean by that?
ASUKA:Just take a look in the mirror.
SHINJI:It's not about my looks.You're making fun of me
- when you say thingslike that out loud.- Oh, man.
What a peaceful day.
(tires screeching)
- Oh!- Ms. Misato is here!
(car door closes)
BOYS:Wow!
TOHJI:Man, I love our teacher!
ALL:Ee!
BOTH:Get a load of the idiot trio.
Bunch of morons.
(bell chiming)
HIKARI:All rise. Bow. Be seated.
All right, boys, get ready.
I have a new transfer studentI'd like to introduce you to.
I'm Rei Ayanami.Nice to meet ya.
- Ah!- You!
You're that pervertthat ogled my panties.
Hold on a minute, don't youslander Shinji like that!
You forced himto see your crotch.
What's this got to do with you?
Why are you defending him?
You two seeing each otheror something?
We're just childhood friends.
We're just childhood friends.Draws Back
You shut your mouth.Draws Back
Would you be quiet?Class is in session!
Eh, I want to seehow this turns out.
It's way more funthan what I teach.
Please, continue.
(laughter)
SHINJI:I see.
This is a world as well.
A possibility that's inside me.
What I am nowisn't everything I'll ever be.
It's possible to havedifferent versions of myself.
That means, it's possiblethere's a version of me
that is not an Eva pilot.
MISATO:If you hold onto that outlook,
this real worldisn't such a bad place.
SHINJI:The real worldmay not be a bad place,
but I still hate myself.
MAKOTO:It's your heartthat perceives reality
as being harshand full of suffering.
SHIGERU:And your heartinterprets reality
as being the only truth.
MAYA:How you see reality,how you interpret it,
with those thingschanging slightly,
what's inside your heartwill change greatly.
KAJI:There are as many truthsas there are people.
KENSUKE:But there's only onetruth for you,
focused througha narrow worldview
built using informationthat's been altered
for your protection.It's an artificial truth.
TOHJI:Yep, a guy's view of the worldis pretty small.
You're just standingon a molehill.
HIKARI:In the end, people can onlygauge things around them
with their own little yardstick.
ASUKA:People tend to see the worldusing the truths
that others have given them.
MISATO:Be happy on a sunny day.
REI:Be melancholy on a rainy day.
ASUKA:You become stuckfeeling that way
because it's what otherstold you to feel.
RITSUKO:But fun things can happenon a rainy day as well.
FUYUTSUKI:The truth embodiedwithin a person
is delicate and malleable.
That truth can be changed,
depending on how you interpretthe events in your life.
KAJI:That's basically all there isto one person's truth,
and it's why you'll be curious
to find what other,deeper truths await you.
GENDOH:You're simply not accustomedto receiving affection
from other people.
You can take comfortknowing you have no need
to worry about what otherswill think of you all the time.
SHINJI:But doesn't everybody hate me?
You're an idiot.
You just assumed on your own
that everybodythinks that way about you.
SHINJI:But I really do hate myself.
Someone who hates themselveswill project that hate,
and will then be unableto trust others.
I'm dishonest... a coward...
a snake and a weakling.
You can becomekinder to yourself
by learning about yourself.
I hate who I am.
SHINJI, ASUKA, and REI:But still,
maybe I could changeand like myself.
- (glass cracking)- Maybe it's really okay
for me to be here after all.
Yeah, I'm only who I am.
I am me.
I want to be myself.
I want to be here!
It's okay for meto be here in this world.
(cheers and applause)
Congratulations.
- Congratulations.- Congratulations.

EPISODE 25
MAYA:Wait. All the facilitiesin headquarters are on lockdown?
MAKOTO:With security status frozenat alert condition one.
MAYA:But why?
I thought that boywas the last Angel.
SHIGERU:That's what I thought, too.
That should've been all of them.
Doesn't seem like they'reexpecting peace and prosperity.
What about here?And what about the Evas?
And Dr. Akagi still hasn'tcome back.
To be honest, I think NERV'sgonna be broken apart.
But I've got no idea
what's going to happen to usafter all this.
MAKOTO:Well, guess we'll justhave to tough it out
until the InstrumentalityProject starts.
-(insects buzzing)- (traffic passing)
MISATO:Envisioning manas a doomed collective
of flawed individuals,
the Human InstrumentalityProject aims
to artificially evolve humanityinto a perfect single life-form.
True utopia, I guess.
To that end,the Instrumentality Council
is going to resort to usingnot Adam, not NERV, but an Eva.
It's just asyou predicted, Kaji.
SEELE 01:The promised time is upon us.
The Spear of Longinus is lost.
Lilith can no longer realizeour instrumentality.
Now our hopes rest on Unit 01,the sole counterpart of Lilith,
to carry out this sacred duty.
GENDOH:That would deviate fromthe scenario set down by Seele.
Mankind's existence,our only purpose,
is to give birth to the Evas.
GENDOH:Humanity must advanceto a new world.
The Eva series will enable that.
SEELE 09:There is no need for usto abandon our human form
to ride the ark that is the Eva.
SEELE 12:This is an unavoidablerite of passage
for a doomed mankindto be reborn.
SEELE 05:Our extinction will serve
as the rapture for a new birth.
SEELE 04:Death to God, man and all life
so that we may become one.
GENDOH:Death produces nothing.
SEELE 01: Death shall bebestowed upon you.
FUYUTSUKI:The human condition lies
in how it strugglesfor survival.
That was the wish she held onto
when she chose to remainwithin the Eva.
(insects trilling)
(door opens)
(siren blaring in distance)
(birds chirping)
(whirring)
(typing)
So then this iswhat the real truth is
behind the Second Impact.
- (alarm beeping)-They're onto me.
No, wait, it's not me.
-Something's beginning.-(whooshing)
(alarm blaring)
MAN (over P.A.):The link to network sixis down.
Switch the left one tothe blue emergency comm channel.
Patch to a satellite linkif need be.
And the right--what's the situation with that?
MAN (on phone):Communicationsto outside networks
and information feedshave been broken. We're cut off!
Are they after the Magi?
SHIGERU:Data intrusionsat all external terminals.
They are trying to hacktheir way into the Magi.
Just as I thought.
Is the attack of the Maginumber two at Matsushiro?
No, it's at leastfive Magi systems.
We have confirmed intrusionsfrom Germany, China and the U.S.
Seele's attacking uswith everything they've got.
We're hopelessly outnumberedfive to one.
This isn't good.
SHIGERU:Number four firewallhas been breached!
MAKOTO:Shutting down the main database.
What the... It's no use.
I can't stop the intrusions!
MAYA:More intrusionsfrom exterior blocks.
Unable to shut downauxiliary circuits.
FUYUTSUKI:This is bad.
Taking control of the Magiis the same as occupying HQ.
>?
RITSUKO:Let me guess--you want me to activate
the Magi's autonomousdefense measures.
Yes. Lieutenant Ibukiat the Secondary Command Center
will fill you in.
Willing to draga woman he dumped back in
if the need arises.
He's as egocentric as ever.
>?
-Give me a sitrep.-MAKOTO: Good morning, ma'am.
Tokyo-2 has just issuedan A-801.
MISATO:An 801?
MAKOTO:Termination of NERV'slegal protection from the law
and the transfer of commandto the Japanese government.
(whirs, beeps)
It's their final ultimatum.
Yes, that's right.
They are trying to hackinto the Magi as we speak.
It's not looking good for us.
Ibuki here.Dr. Akagi has started work
on reinforcingthe Magi's defenses.
-(buzz, whir)-(both gasp)
Ritsuko.
(rapid typing)
DO NOT STEP! WILL BUCKLE
RITSUKO:Does this make me the fool?
There's no logic in howmen and women interact
with one another.
Isn't that right...
...Mother?
MAN (over P.A.):Gora landlineshave recovered to 0.2%.
-How much longer?-(alarm continues blaring)
MAKOTO:It looks like we'll make it.
Dr. Akagi is reallysomething else.
MISATO:Hacking the Magi can't betheir only plan.
No, they're willingto play hardball if need be.
You know this attackis only the beginning.
Hacking the Magiis just the precursor.
They intend to infiltrate HQ
and securethe two remaining Evas.
GENDOH:I agree.
After all, we haveboth Lilith and Adam.
It's no wonder the old menhave become anxious.
(rapid beeping)
(whooshing)
The hack on the Magijust completely stopped.
-Danang Type B Firewall erected.-AUTOMATED VOICE:Lockdown. Lockdown.
MAYA:The lockdown should be goodfor 62 hours.
AUTOMATED VOICE:Lockdown. Lockdown. Lockdown.
Lockdown. Lockdown.
Till next time, my dear mother.
SEELE 06:Ikari has placed
a Code 666 protectionon the Magi.
Breaching it nowwill prove difficult.
SEELE 07:We'll have to suspend effortsto commandeer the Magi.
SEELE 01:We had meant this takeoverto be peaceful,
but it seems we haveno other choice.
Breach and occupy HQ by force.
(insects buzzing)
(birds chirping)
Let's get started.
Proceed as planned.
(aircraft whooshing overhead)
MAYA:Radar sites numbers eightthrough 17 are off-line.
SHIGERU:An artillery battalion
has penetratedthe Gora defense line.
MAKOTO:Two more battalions approaching
from the Gotenba area.
After everything,it's just as I predicted.
Our final enemy would beour fellow man.
GENDOH:All personnel,battle stations condition one.
Battle stations, sir?
I don't understand.They're not Angels.
They're human, just like us.
The guys after usdon't see it that way.
(rumbling)
-(knife thuds)-(muffled grunt)
(alarm blaring)
Wait. What was that? Hey.
-What's going on?-I don't know.
It's the south hub station.
(alarm blaring)
MAN:Daigatake tunnelhas been blocked!
MAN 2:Fire in west number fivetransport corridor!
MAN 3:The intruding forcehas infiltrated Level 1.
The units in the west buildingare a diversion.
If their objective is the Evas,
then logicallythey'd go after the pilots.
Have Shinji take refugein Unit 01 on the double.
-Yes, ma'am.-Where's Asuka?
Hospital room 303.
A. LANGLEY SORYU
MISATO:Have her board Unit 02.
Asuka still can't synchronizewith an Eva.
She won't be ableto do anything.
She'll be neutralizedif she stays in that room.
Our best option is to at leastput her inside an Eva.
Understood.Discontinue medicating pilot.
Once Asuka's inside Unit 02,
hide it at the bottomof the subterranean lake.
They'll still find her soon,
but it's betterthan being in the cage.
Where's Rei?
Rei's location is unknown.
We can't find her.
She'll be killed out there.Find her quickly.
(deep burbling)
MAKOTO:Launching Unit 02, Route 8.
Placing her 70 below surface.
Prepare to launch Unit 01 next.
Position himwithin the Geo-Front.
We can't yet.
-The pilot is hiding.-(gasps)
What's he doing?
WOMAN (over P.A.):Central Dogma, Level 2,
adjacent blast doorsnow locked down.
All noncombatants,evacuate through passageway 87.
SHIGERU:Underground number threebarriers breached.
The intrudershave entered Level 2.
A division-sized SSDF forcemust have been deployed.
We will be overrun eventually.
Professor Fuyutsuki,would you look after things?
I understand.
Give my regards to Yui.
MAN:Members of Group 2not responding.
MAN 2:Mainframe room 77, contact lost.
Maglev rail number 52has been demolished.
Absolute scumbags.
They make Angels look civilized.
MISATO:Of course he'd feel that way.
Our people aren'tused to killing others.
(woman crying)
Oh!
Sever any red cables first.After that...
(woman screaming)
Confirmed-- intruders haveentered Level 3, Block B.
-We can't stop 'em!-SHIGERU: Block F, as well.
The main bypass is being hitfrom two fronts.
Abandon Level 3and everything above.
Tell our forces to pull back.
Inject Bakelite into allpassageways and exchange pipes
-up to Sector 803.-Roger.
WOMAN (over P.A.):Injecting Bakelitefrom number 703.
Flooding will complete in 30.
Injecting Bakelitefrom number 7373.
That should hold them backfor a while.
MAKOTO: Major Katsuragi,Route 47 is cut off,
so Group 3 isn't ableto advance.
They can't rescue Shinji!
(gunfire, explosionsin distance)
MISATO:Noncombatants should avoidclose-quarters combat.
We're up against pros.
Anyone who can't retreatinto the Dogma should surrender.
-Please take careof things for me.-Ma'am.
SOLDIER:Forget Mount Futago.Seal off Nagao Touge.
SOLDIER 2:This is a lot more troublethan we thought it'd be.
This is bad.Headquarters isn't equipped
with antipersonnel defenses,so there's not much
we can do to stop them.We're screwed.
Yeah, just someanti-terrorist stuff.
If the SSDF reallyput their mind to it,
this place and everyone in itwill be toast in no time.
Now that you mention it,it was strange how
our intruder prevention budgetwas slashed.
Maybe it's 'cause they wereplanning for this raid.
It's certainly possible.
- (explosion)-(yells)
(grunts)
WOMAN (over P.A.):Intruders have entered
the Second Command Center,left wing...
Turn off the safety.
I just... I don't think I havewhat it takes to use this thing.
You've had loadsof practice time with a gun!
That was different! I never hadto shoot at people back then!
-(gun fires, bullet ricochets)-(gasps)
Get over it!You'll die if you don't!
(deep burbling)
GENDOH:Rei.
I knew I'd find you here.
(footsteps approaching)
The promised time has come,so let's go.
(distant gunfire, explosions)
SOLDIER:We just finishedsecuring Level 2. Over.
SOLDIER 2 (over radio):Secondary Command Center
and the Magi originalhaven't been secured yet.
Currently engaging targetfrom left wing, lower floor.
SOLDIER 3 (over radio):Begin cooling cycle
on 5th Bolgia immediately.
(gunshot)
OFFICER (over radio):Eva pilots must beterminated on sight.
Fire at willat all noncombatants.
OFFICER 2 (over radio):Yanagihara, Shinjyo Force,
breach the lower level now.
(gun fires, bullet ricochets)
- (footsteps rapidly approaching)-(guns clicking)
Third found.Neutralizing target.
(guns cocking)
Sorry. Nothing personal, kid.
-(gunshot)-(yells)
(soldiers grunting)
(gun cocks)
Sorry. It's nothing personal.
(gunshot)
All right. Come on.
Let's get you to Unit 01.
(radio warbling)
(indistinct radio chatterthrough static)
MISATO (sighs):Bastards.
They're gonna set up blockades
to keep youfrom reaching Unit 01.
We don't have much time.
We need to hurry.
Shinji.
You have a decision to make.
You can either run away,or you can get to Unit 01.
You can't sit thereand do nothing.
You'll die, Shinji.
SHINJI (whispering):Help me, Asuka.
Please help me.
MISATO:Look at you-- escaping reality
and asking some girlto solve your problems for you?
You can't half-ass your waythrough this.
(footsteps approaching)
Come on, damn it. Stand up!
Stand up!
SHINJI:No more. I want to die.
I don't want to do anything.
MISATO:This isn't the timeto throw a tantrum.
Your life isn't over yet.Got that?
Live your life standing up!
Then you can die.
(heavy gunfire)
Forget us.Priority one is keeping them
out of the Terminal Dogmaat all costs.
(grunts) They've blown apart
every other sectionof headquarters,
but they seem to bemore careful here.
I'm sure they'd likenothing more
than to go all out against us,
but with the Magi original here,they can't.
They must want to secure it
with as little damageas possible.
We've got very fewbiochemical countermeasures.
We'd be screwedif they used any.
MAKOTO:Don't forget N2 bombs.
(whooshing)
(explosive whooshing)
(electrical crackling)
(rumbling)
Speaking of bombs.
Don't those pricks knowbigger doesn't mean better?
Huh. That was reckless.
(bombs whistling)
Why?! Why do they wantthe Evas so badly?!
MISATO:They plan to startthe Third Impact
using the Eva seriesinstead of an Angel.
The Second Impact 15 years agowas set off by us, mankind.
Humanity tried to revert Adamback to its egg state.
They had to do it beforethe other Angels could awaken.
It was all they could do
to keep the ensuing disasterto a minimum.
Listen carefully to whatI'm about to say next, Shinji.
We humans came froma source of life called Lilith,
which is also like Adam.
That makes us the 18th Angel.
The other Angels wereother possibilities,
how humanity could have been,
but sadly none of them, nor us,could coexist with one another.
While we're all humans,only one of us could thrive.
Shinji, I need you to eradicatethe Eva series.
It's the only way we'll survive.

What were they thinking?
Triggering the Third Impact,obliterating mankind?
It's outrageous.
SECRETARY:Only man is capable of harboring
such contempt for itself.
PRIME MINISTER:The question is:
What do we dowith NERV HQ facilities?
SECRETARY:Are you planning to outsource
its redevelopmentto the Germans or Chinese?
PRIME MINISTER:They'll just rob us blind.
No, I think it's betterto shut it down
and let it rot for 20 years,same as Old Tokyo.
SOLDIER (over radio):Surface heat has dissipated.
High-pressure steam should notbe an issue anymore.
SOLDIER 2:Initial deploymentof all units complete.
We currently have Dogma Level 3and the purple one secured.
What about the red one?
It's in the subterranean lakeat depth 70.
However, we are still uncertainof the pilot's status.

-(yells)-(roaring)
ASUKA:Mother. Mom!
I understand now.
The meaning of the A.T. Field.
You were protecting me.
You were looking over me.
It was you the whole time.You were with me!
Mom!
MAYA (over radio):Eva Unit 02 has activated!
Asuka's okay! She's alive!
MISATO:Asuka?
OFFICER:Shoot the cable.
That cable gives it its power.
Concentrate your fire on it!
-(alarm beeps)- (scoffs)
Who cares ifmy umbilical cable's cut?
I still got 12,000 layersof specialized armor!
And don't forget aboutmy A.T. Field.
(grunts)
Did you actually thinkI'd lose?!
To amateurs like you?!
(growls)
SEELE 01:Eva, the cursed existence,
it dares to standin our way once more.
No matter.
We will conquer evil with evil.
(whooshing)
The Eva series.
They completed them already.
Truly astonishing.
They actually deployedall nine Evas
equipped with S2 drives.
They're really going overboard.
Unless-- do they intendto set it off now?
MISATO:Listen, Asuka.
You have to destroythe Eva series
no matter the cost.
Shinji will be out there soonto help you.
-Just hang tight.- (phone beeps)
So, is emergency Route 20 stillopen to get to Eva Unit 012?
MAKOTO (over phone):Yes, I've secured
triple redundancies for power.
The direct routeto cage seven is good
for another three minutes.
(phone beeps)
ASUKA:I have to destroyall of them, huh?
For someonewho was just comatose,
-that's quite a lot to ask.-(rapid beeping)
Three and a half minutesto get all nine Evas?
That's 20 seconds each,so I better get to work, then.
(Asuka yelling)

This is it.
(heavy gunfire)
(whimpers)
They got away.
Unable to neutralize target.
-Should we continue the pursuit?-OFFICER (over radio): Negative.
That area is designatedfor demolition.
Evacuate immediately.
Roger.
(panting):This... should buy us some time.
I'm okay.
(groaning):It's not as bad as it looks.
(beep)
The power's good.
You'll make it.
(gasps)
Shinji, listen to me.
From now on, you're on your own.
You have to makeyour own decisions.
You can't ask for help.
SHINJI:No, I can't do it.
I'm worthless.
I don't deserve to pilot an Eva.
I've hurt people.I've killed people.
I used to think piloting an Evawas something I had to do,
but I was lying to myself.
I don't understand any of this.
I don't deserve to be a pilot.
I can't help other people.I can't do anything.
I'm useless!
I've done horrible thingsto Asuka.
I killed Kaworu.
There's nothing goodinside me at all.
I'm a sneak, a coward.
All I've ever done ishurt the people around me!
That's whyI shouldn't do anything!
If you're expecting sympathy,forget it.
If all you care about isavoiding pain and heartbreak,
then do nothing and die.
(crying)
Stop it! Crying won't fixany of your problems!
(continues crying)
You hate yourself.
That's why you hurt others.
You do it because you knowthe pain it brings you
is far harsher than the painanyone else can do to you.
No matter what happens,what follows is the result
of your own decisions, Shinji.
And that's something meaningful.
You and you alone madea difference right there.
Don't look away.
Think about what you can do,and make amends any way you can.
SHINJI (crying):What do you know?
You don't knowanything about me!
You're just a stranger!
I'm a stranger to you?!Fine, I don't care!
You want to quit? Is that it?
If you don't do anythingright now,
I won't ever forgive you.
I will curse your nameuntil the day I die.
Who you think you are right nowisn't everything.
You'll realize how wrong you arethinking like that
and then regret it.
I'd be elated one second,
then hate myself the nextin an endless cycle,
but I moved onone step at a time.
Listen, Shinji,
pilot the Eva againand settle things.
Get closure as an Eva pilot.
Figure out why you came here,what you were meant to do.
Get the answers you need,Shinji.
And afterwards,when you've worked it all out,
make sure you come back, okay?
Promise me that.
(grunts softly)
Take care of yourself.
That's how grown-ups kiss.
We'll do the restwhen you get back, all right?
(gasps)
(whirring)
(exhales)
(weakly):If I'd known this would happen,
I'd have done what Asuka said...
...and changed the carpetlike she wanted.
Right, Pen-Pen?
Hey, Kaji.
I did the right thing, didn't I?

What's going on out there?
In less than one minute,Unit 02 will be out of power.
She won't make it. Asuka!

ASUKA:I'll kill you, I'll kill you,
I'll kill you, I'll kill you,Ill kill you,
Ill kill you,I'll kill you, I'll kill you,
-I'll ki...- (crunching)

MAYA (over speaker):Shinji! Unit 02 is...
Asuka is... Asuka!
SHINJI:I can't do anything
if I can't get into the Eva.
(rumbling, creaking)
Mother?
Unit 01 must have activated.

Thank you very much.- Hideaki ANNO
GENDOH:I am already one with Adam.
And through the forbidden fusionof Adam and Lilith,
I have the chance to be reunitedonce again with Yui.
We're running out of time.
Your A.T. Fieldcan't maintain your form.
Rei, let's begin.
Let go of your A.T. Field.
Release the wallsaround your heart.
We shall make imperfect heartswhole again.
Cast aside your body.
We will unite every soulinto one.
And then let us goto where Yui awaits us.

High-velocity object approachingfrom beyond satellite orbit.
What'd you say?
Damn it.It's the Spear of Longinus.
SEELE 01:Our wish shallfinally be granted.
SEELE 04:It appears the original
Spear of Longinushas returned to Earth.
SEELE 09:While we may be shorton numbers,
this will have to do.
ALL:Return the Eva seriesto their original form,
back to their true form,
that which bestows the gospelupon humanity.
With death and prayerin equal measure,
return man to his true form.
SEELE 01:Only then will peacevisit our souls.
Now, let the ceremony begin.
(grunts)
(groaning)
(alarm blaring)
Eva Unit 01 has beentaken into custody.
Altitude increasing fast--12,000 and rising.
Bastards.
Seele wants Unit 01to be the sacrificial medium.
(shuddering breaths)
SEELE 09:The stigmata has been brandedupon Eva Unit 01.
ALL:Now is the timeto resurrect the Central Tree.
SEELE 01:Our subjects, the Eva series,
exist solely for this purpose.
SHIGERU:The Eva series areoverloading their S2 drives.
MAKOTO:Dimensional flux valueshave inverted.
They're in the negative range.
The system can't read it.
It can't assign numeric values.
It must be an anti-A.T. Field.
(whirring)
MAYA:This phenomenon isexactly like 15 years ago.
So, then, does that meanthat the...
the Third Impactis about to start?
SOLDIER:S2 drive has hit critical!
SOLDIER 2:Intermolecular forcecannot be maintained any longer!
So that's it, then.
We have failed our mission.
(rumbling)
(explosive whooshing)
- (explosion)-(rumbling)
Direct hit! Sedimentary layershave liquefied!
Secondary blast digging awayat circumference of HQ!
The exterior is exposed!
It's still onlya physical impact wave.
Absorbers at maximum power.We'll make it through this.

SEELE 08:With this purification...
SEELE 09:Of the red claythat bespeaks of eternity...
SEELE 11:The Geo-Front shall return...
To its true form.
(muffled rumbling)
FUYUTSUKI:The origin of life,
the egg of Lilith.
The Black Moon.
We have no desireto return inside it,
but all of it restswith Lilith now.
GENDOH:It appears the curtainshave been raised.
Now, Rei, be my guide
and help me unitewith Yui once again.
What?
I cannot do that for you.
I am not your doll.
(gasps) Why?
Because I am not you.That's why.
(gasps) Rei!
Wait, please.
Rei, please, I'm begging you!
I can't.
Shinji is calling for me.
(grunts) Rei!
I am home.
"WELCOME BACK."

Rei.
SHIGERU:Unknown high-energyobject detected.
Whatever it is, it's descendingfrom the Terminal Dogma.
Confirming A.T. Field.
It's Pattern Blue!
Wait, it's an Angel?

ALL:With the Unit 01 pilot's egonow absent,
we shall realizeman's instrumentality.
The time of the thirdtribulation is now at hand.
(distorted laughter)

The AT. Fields ofthe Eva series are resonating.
Their signal keeps amplifying.
They must have startedtheir fusion to Rei.

SHIGERU:Psychograph signal is weakening.
Destrudo rising.
It's beginning to surface.
It's going too high.
The pilot's egowon't last much longer.
(Shinji crying)
No more.
No more. No more.
No more.
KAWORU:Are you all right?
(gasps)
There you are.
Kaworu, it's you.
>?
(growling)
SHIGERU:Solenoid graph readingshave inverted.
The ego boundary of the pilotis weakening.
A.T. Field has changedto Pattern Red.
It has begun.
The Angels' Fruit of Life
and man's Fruit of Knowledge.
With Eva Unit 01now possessing both,
it has become an entityequivalent to God.
It has reconstituted itself
as the Tree of Life,the proto-embryo.
Whether it becomesthe ark that saves man
from the voidof the Third Impact
or the devilthat will doom mankind,
from this moment forward,
everything hingeson lkari's son.
MAYA (crying):We... we didthe right thing, right?
SHIGERU:How would I know?
(distorted giggling)
YUI:As of now, Rei is in your heart.
A perfect reflectionof your wishes.
REI:What do you wish for?
>?
(drip echoes)
(squeaking)
(whimsical musicplaying faintly)
SHINJI:Yeah.
It's just like whenI started playing the cello.
I thought somethingwould change if I came here.
CHILD:Let's play together, Shinji.
CHILD 2:We'll build a castle together.
It'll be so much fun.

ASUKA:Oh, for the love of...
Just looking at you
makes my blood boil!
-Because you only see you?-Mommy!
(whispers):Mommy.
Mother.
MISATO:In the end, I guess
I wasn't ableto be Shinji's mother.
(fan whirring)
Come on, let's do it again.
KAJL:Again?
I thought you were gonnameet a friend on campus.
MISATO:Hmm? Oh.
Oh, Ritsuko?
Don't worry, we still haveplenty of time.
KAJI:It's been a whole week
since we've beenlying around like this.
MISATO:Yeah, but I think
I'm finally startingto get the hang of this.
Come on, don't make me beg.
(Kaji moans softly)
MISATO:I think we do this
to confirm thatwe're really here.
To affirm our self-worth.
ASUKA:That's the dumbest thingI've ever heard!
It's just two adults comfortingeach other from loneliness!
RITSUKO:All they're after iseach other's physical pleasure.
MISATO:It's about morethan just the physical.
It feels good to be desired.
ASUKA:Well, seems likea pretty easy way
to affirm your own self-worth.
(Misato moaning)
SHINJI:This person,this is Misato, isn't it?
MISATO:Yes, it's me-- a part of me.
A part of methat you never knew before.
But now, throughour melded hearts, you do.
Pain is an inevitableconsequence of truth.
You need to learnto withstand that pain.
ASUKA:Wow, I wonder if I'll belike Misato when I grow up,
doing stuff like this.
Hey, Shinji,
do you want to try a kiss?
-No way.-Oh, so you're afraid.
MISATO:Children shouldn'tbe doing that.
Well, get ready.
You don't knowthe first thing about me,
so just stay away, you got that?
SHINJI:I do know.
No, you do not know, idiot!
How could someone like you everknow anything about who I am?!
You actually thinkyou can save me.
I didn't know you were capableof being so arrogant.
What is wrong with you?
What do you mean,what's wrong with me?
Asuka, you never talk to me.
You never talk to meor tell me anything.
Of course I wouldn'tunderstand you. How could 1?!
Did you even try to understand?
Of course I tried.
ASUKA:You idiot!
Hey, I know you've beenjerking off to me.
Come on, do it right now.
Do it right here.
I want to watch you do it.
Listen to me.
If you can't be all mine,then I don't need you!
So then be nice to meif that's what you want.
ASUKA, MISATO and REI:I am nice to you.
SHINJI:You're lying! I can seethrough your fake smiles!
You're never honest with me!
You'd ratherkeep everything vague!
REI:Because telling the truthhurts others.
It's a painful experience.
SHINJI:But that vagueness,it's suffocating me.
REI:You're just desperate.
SHINJI:I'm terrified.
I'm scared that peoplewould abandon me all over again.
It's gnawing at me.
I feel anxious.Say something to me.
Talk to me, please!
(echoing):Don't ignore me!
>?
Oh, come on,I want to be useful.
I want to be together forever.
ASUKA:Then don't do anything.
Don't come near me.
If you do, you'll justend up hurting me.
Asuka, help me, please.
Asuka, you'rethe only one for me.
-You're lying.-(gasps)
You know you are.You'd run off to anyone.
You're afraid of Misato and Rei!
-You're afraid of your fatherand your mother!-Asuka.
-It's just that nowyou're only running to me!-Help me, Asuka.
It's the easiestand least painful thing to do!
Come on, Asuka, help me!
The truth is you've neverreally loved anybody!
(gasps)
-(coffee sizzling)-You're the only one here,
and you've never been able tobring yourself to like yourself!
Pathetic.
SHINJI (softly):Help me.
Please...
someone, I'm begging you,help me.
Help me.
(voice trembling):Help me.
Why won't you help me?!
-(clattering)-Don't leave me alone!
Don't abandon me!
Don't kill me!
(Shinji crying softly)
No.
("Komm, Siisser Tod" by Arianneplaying)
SHINJI:No one understands me.
REI:You understood nothing.
SHINJI:I thought the worldwas free of pain,
it was concrete and perfect.
REI:You jumped to conclusions.
You thought everybodywas just like you.
SHINJI:You betrayed me.
You betrayed my feelings!
REI:Self-absorbed from the start,
you saw thingsas you wanted to see them.
SHINJI:No one wants me.
That's why everybody should die.
REI:Then tell me,why do you have hands?
SHINJI:Everybody would be the sameeven if I wasn't here.
Nothing would change.
That's why everybody should die.
REI:Then tell me,why do you have a heart?
SHINJI:Actually, it'd be betterif I didn't exist,
so I should die, too.
REI:Then why are you here?
(crying)
SHINJI:Is it all right if I'm here?

-2 It's killing me inside... }-(Rei giggling)
For so long,
I've waited for this moment with bated breath.
At long last,we meet again, Yui.
I have always known that
I'll only hurt Shinji if I'm with him.
Leaving him alone was the best thing that I could do.
You were afraid of Shinji.That's why.
I have no faith in me being loved by other people.
I do not deserve to be loved or feel love.
KAWORU: You chose to look away.
You turned away and refused the world
because you're afraid of feeling any pain.
Afraid of that invisible,formless something
that exists between people.
As a result,you walled off your heart
from the world, didn't you?
And now I reap the seeds that I have sown.
-Forgive me, Shinji.-
(growls)
It all returns to nothing
I just keep letting me down
Letting me down, letting me down

Ayanami? Rei?

MISATO: If it hurts you so much,
you can give up.
REI: If you don't like it very much, you can run away.
MISATO: You want relief.
You want peace.
You want to be one with me.
In body and soul.
It's something that feels really good.
ASUKA:But not with you.
Not even if I'm dead.
SHINJI: Um...
MISATO: What is it?
SHINJI: What are dreams?
MISATO: Dreams?
REI: Yes, dreams.
"DOES IT FEEL GOOD?"
SHINJI: I don't understand.
I don't understand reality too well.
REI: So, you can't grasp the border
that sets apart your truths from others' reality?
SHINJI: I can't figure out where happiness lies.
REI: The only place where you can find happiness
is inside dreams, isn't it?
SHINJI: So that's why this isn't reality.
It's a world devoid of people.
REI:Yes, a dream.
SHINJI:That's why I'm not here.
REI:You made a convenient fantasy
to take revenge against reality.
SHINJI: What's wrong with that?
REI: You were avoiding the truth
by escaping into a fabricated world.
SHINJI: What's wrong with having your own private dream?
REI: That's not a dream.
That's just a substitute for reality.
(quiet chatter)
(chatter fades)
SHINJI: So, then, where are my dreams?
REI: They're beyond where reality lies.
SHINJI: Then where is my reality?
REI :Reality comes after the dream.
(explosive whooshing)
SHINJI: Ayanami.
Where am I?
You are in an ocean of LCL.
A sea of the origin of life.
A world without A.T. Fields,
where the self has no form.
A world where you don't know where you end and others begin.
An ambiguous world.
A world where you are everywhere
and nowhere at the same time.
A fragile world.
Does this mean I'm dead?
You're not.
Here, everyone has merged into one.
It's the world you wanted.
I think this is different from what I want.
REI:If you wish for the existence of others,
the inner walls will come back.
Also, it will bring back the fear of the other.
It's okay.
Thank you.
I always felt
like only bad things happened back there.
That's probably whyI was willing to run away.
But running away didn't help anything,
because thenI'm not there anymore,
and that's the same as no one existing at all.
And you're okay with AT. Fields?
Them causing pain in yourself and in others?
I'll be okay.
But who are you two inside my heart?
We are the hope.
The hope that humanity might
reconcile with each other without misunderstanding.
KAWORU: Together, along with the word "love."
SHINJI: But that's just a sham.
Just me making assumptions again.
It's more of a prayer.
It won't last forever.
Sooner or later,I'll be betrayed.
I'll be abandoned.
But still, I feel likeI want to meet others again.
And I think that feeling is genuine.
(growls)
(howling and whooshing)
(rumbling)
(explosive whooshing)
KAWORU: Reality lies in places we can't perceive.
Dreams lie within reality.
REI: And we hold the truth within our hearts.
KAWORU: The human heart creates the form that we assume.
REI: What's more,new visions will change
that person's heart and therefore their forms.
Visions, the power to imagine,
create people's futures and the flow of time.
KAWORU: But humanity won't change
unless people acton their own initiative.
REI:That is why you must reclaim
your lost self through your own efforts,
even if you lose your own words,
even if you're taken by the words of others.
(whirring)
(high-pitched whirring)
REI: If one can envision their own image,
one can reclaim their own form.
(whooshing)
YUI: Don't worry.
There's a drive in all life that pushes it to restore itself.
There's a heart that strives to live on.
As long as there is the will to live,
you can turn any place into a paradise.
After all, you are alive.
Opportunities for happiness are everywhere.
As long as there is the sun,the moon and the Earth,
it will all work out.
(drip echoes)
Will you be okay?
SHINJI:I still have no idea where happiness lies.
But I'll stay here and keep thinking about being born,
about my life.
I'm sure I'll just realize the obvious over and over,
just so that I can stay being who I am.
But, Mother...
...what will happen to you?
FUYUTSUKI: Man built an Eva in the image of God.
Is that your true purpose?
YUI:Yes.
Humanity can only live on this planet.
However, an Eva can go onto live forever.
Together with the hearts of people embodied within it.
Even after five billion years,
long after the Earth,sun and moon are gone,
the Eva will remain,
even if you are alone.
It would be very lonely,but you would still be alive.
FUYUTSUKI: Proof that humanity lived
will remain behind forever.
SHINJI:Goodbye, Mother.
